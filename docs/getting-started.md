Hosting and collaboration on code in Radicle relies on two clients: the Radicle CLI and Radicle Upstream. The Radicle
CLI handles identity and interacting with Git to push code to the network, while Upstream provides a visual layer for
collaborating on patches to your projects.

In this getting started guide, you'll Radicle CLI and create a Radicle identity, which are the first two steps in
accessing the Radicle network.

## Install the Radicle CLI

The easiest way to install the Radicle CLI on **Linux** and **x86_64 macOS** systems is compiling from the source code
stored on a Radicle seed node. Make sure you have
[Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installed,
then run:

```
$ cargo install --force --locked --git https://seed.alt-clients.radicle.xyz/radicle-cli.git radicle-cli
```

When finished, you'll be able to use the `rad` command for managing projects and interacting with the Radicle network.

> See the [radicle-cli
> repository](https://app.radicle.network/alt-clients.radicle.eth/rad:git:hnrkmg77m8tfzj4gi4pa4mbhgysfgzwntjpao/) for
> other installation methods and instructions.

> **M1/Apple Silicon users**: We're still working on an ideal installation method for running Radicle CLI on your
> machine&mdash;see [our M1 troubleshooting
> section](understanding-radicle/troubleshooting.md#install-radicle-cli-on-apple-silicon) for our latest progress until
> we're ready to publish an official method.

## Create your Radicle identity

To interact with the Radicle network, you need an **identity**, which you generate with `rad auth`.

After choosing a display name and setting a passphrase, the Radicle CLI generates two unique identifiers.

First is your **Peer ID**, which identifies your device and the code you publish on the Radicle network, and is secured
with an Ed25519 keypair. Second is your **personal ðŸŒ± URN**, which identifies you across devices.

```
$ rad auth
Initializing your ðŸŒ± profile and identity

ok Username Â· 
ok Passphrase Â· ********
ok Creating your ðŸŒ± Ed25519 keypair...
ok Adding to ssh-agent...
ok Profile 3ae66df3-6ac7-4466-9013-83839749ed05 created.

Your radicle Peer ID is hyncoz7x4s8x9447g6yogy4iy41q8i4juy5uhou57w1ga7obt644wo. This identifies your device.
Your personal ðŸŒ± URN is rad:git:hnrkmx6trm4bu19bwa4apbxj8ftw8f7amfdyy. This identifies you across devices.

=> To create a radicle project, run `rad init` from a git repository.
```

> There is currently no way to retrieve a lost or forgotten passphrase, so please store it safely!

You can use `rad auth` to create and manage multiple Radicle identities via profiles, but we'll stick with one for now.

## Further `rad` usage

The `rad` CLI tool comes with a number of useful commands for recalling details about your identity or the projects
you've already synced with the Radicle network.

- `rad help`: See all the commands provided by `rad`.
- `rad self`: See information about your current profile and display name, URN, Peer ID, and keys.
- `rad ls`: View a list of your synced Radicle projects.
- `rad [command] --help`: See additional options for an individual command.

## What's next?

The next best steps depends mostly on how you're most likely to interact with projects hosted on the Radicle network.

If you're a maintainer (delegate) of a project:

- [View and share projects](using-radicle/view-share.md)
- [Review and merge patches](using-radicle/track-review-merge.md)

If you're a collaborator:

- [View and share projects](using-radicle/view-share.md)
- [Clone a project](using-radicle/clone.md)
- [Push changes](using-radicle/push.md)

> community](get-involved/join-the-community) to learn more about the future of Radicle or contribute code,
> documentation, or design.
