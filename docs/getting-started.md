## Download & Installation

The Radicle network can be accessed via **Radicle Upstream**, an open-source
desktop client.

Radicle development is public by default and completely open-source. You can
follow along development in our [Matrix channel][mc] or on
[radicle.community][co]. For more information on our community channels, see
[Join our Community][cc].

### Supported Platforms

Radicle Upstream is available for download on Linux and macOS (version 10.14 and
newer).

**â†’ [Download Radicle Upstream for Linux (AppImage)][d1]**

**â†’ [Download Radicle Upstream for macOS (dmg)][d2]**

Once you've downloaded the binary for your respective platform, start it like
this:

#### On Linux:

1. Make the package executable with: `chmod +x radicle-upstream-X.X.X.AppImage`
2. Start the app: `./radicle-upstream-X.X.X.AppImage`

#### On macOS:

1. Open the `radicle-upstream-x.x.x.dmg` package and install Upstream by
   dragging the `Radicle Upstream` binary to the `/Applications` folder.

If you are installing on a [Mac computer with Apple Silicon ][as] please note
that you may experience issues as Radicle Upstream has not been tested on the
Apple Silicon platform.

<blockquote>
While we are participating in the Apple Developer Program to ensure
accessibility to our macOS users, we do not agree with Apple's financial
gatekeeping and increasing control over application distribution on their
platform. Forcing developers to "pay-to-play" under the guise of a security
solution is an extractive form of vendor lock-in that inhibits the growth and
accessibility of open software.
</blockquote>

If you are running a different operating system (e.g. NixOS or an older macOS)
you can trying [building Radicle Upstream from source][bs].


## Creating an identity
To create an identity on the Radicle network, use the Upstream client.
After choosing a display name and setting a passphrase, it will generate a
unique identifier â€” known as a [**Device ID**][di] â€” that's paired to the
computer you've installed it on. 

For now, this Device ID is the only way other users can find and collaborate
with you. Later on, you will be able to manage multiple Device IDs under one
user handle, enabling support and consistency across multiple devices.

![Identity][id]

### Setting a passphrase
The client will also prompt you to create a passphrase. This passphrase *isn't* a
private key â€” it is a password that decrypts your keypair to access and publish
to the network. You will also be prompted for this passphrase when
pushing and fetching code from your local machine to Radicle via
your command line.

<blockquote>
There is no way to recover this passphrase yet, so be sure to keep it in a very
safe place!
</blockquote>

## Configuring your system

### Setting up Git
To create and publish projects to the network, you must make sure your
commits are associated with a username in Git.

You can do so by running the following command:

```
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
```
For more help, refer to the relevant [Git documentation][gd].

### Adding the remote helper
To publish code to the network via the Upstream client, you first have
to add the Radicle gitremote-helper to your shell configuration.

- Add `export PATH="$HOME/.radicle/bin:$PATH"` to your shell configuration
- Restart your shell
- Check that the remote helper is available in your path by running:

```
$ which git-remote-rad
<home path>/.radicle/bin/git-remote-rad
```

With the remote helper installed, you will be able to [push changes][pc] from
your working copies to your Radicle [monorepo][ri] or [fetch changes][fc] from
other peers via the `rad` remote. The Upstream client then publishes
these changes to the network.
