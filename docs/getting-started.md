## Download & Installation

The Radicle network can be accessed via **Radicle Upstream**, an open-source
desktop client.

Radicle development is public by default and completely open-source. You can
follow along development in our [Matrix channel][mc] or on
[radicle.community][co].

### Supported Platforms

Radicle Upstream is available for download on Linux and macOS (version 10.14 and
newer). 

**-> [Download Radicle Upstream][bk]**

Once you've downloaded the binary for your respective platform, start it like
this:

#### On Linux:

1. Make the package executable with: `chmod +x radicle-upstream-X.X.X.AppImage`
2. Start the app: `./radicle-upstream-X.X.X.AppImage`

#### On macOS:

**Note**: before you can start Upstream for the first time, you'll have to
perform some extra steps. This is because we haven't set up [Apple
notarization][an] for Upstream yet â€” read more about it [here][aw]. You'll only
have to do this once -- the first time you launch the app.

1. Open the `radicle-upstream-x.x.x.dmg` package and install Upstream by
   dragging the `Radicle Upstream` binary to the `/Applications` folder.

  <source src="/img/macOS-install.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

2. Open `/Applications` in finder, locate the `Radicle Upstream` app and
   right-click it, then select `Open` from the context menu. You should see a
   dialog with two buttons `Move to Bin` and `Cancel`.

3. Dismiss the dialog by clicking `Cancel` to bypass macOS security measures
   which disallow running unsigned binaries. Repeat the previous step. You
   should now see three buttons: `Move to Bin`, `Open` and `Cancel`, click
   `Open`.

If you are installing on a [Mac computer with Apple Silicon ][as] please note
that you may experience issues as Radicle Upstream has not been tested on the
Apple Silicon platform.

<blockquote>
While we will be participating in the Apple Developer Program to ensure
accessibility to our macOS users, we do not agree with Apple's financial
gatekeeping and increasing control over application distribution on their
platform. Forcing developers to "pay-to-play" under the guise of a security
solution is an extractive form of vendor lock-in that inhibits the growth and
accessibility of open software.
</blockquote>

If you are running a different operating system (e.g. NixOS or an older macOS)
you can trying [building Radicle Upstream from source][bs].


## Creating an identity
To create an identity on the Radicle network, use the Radicle Upstream client.
After choosing a display name and setting a passphrase, it will generate a
unique identifier â€” known as a [**Device ID**][di] â€” that's paired to the
computer you've installed it on. 

For now, this Device ID is the only way other users can find and collaborate
with you. Later on, you will be able to manage multiple Device IDs under one
user handle, enabling support and consistency across multiple devices.

![Identity][id]

### Setting a passphrase
The app will also prompt you to create a passphrase. This passphrase *isn't* a
private key â€” it is a password that decrypts your keypair to access and publish
to the Upstream client. You will also be prompted for this passphrase when
pushing and fetching code from your local machine to the Radicle network via
your command line.

<blockquote>
There is no way to recover this passphrase yet, so be sure to keep it in a very
safe place!
</blockquote>

## Configuring your system

### Setting up Git
To create and publish projects to the Radicle network, you must make sure your
commits are associated with a username in Git.

You can do so by running the following command:

```
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
```
For more help, refer to the relevant [Git documentation][gd].

### Adding the remote helper
To publish code to the Radicle network via the Upstream client, you first have
to add the Radicle gitremote-helper to your shell configuration.

- Add `export PATH="$HOME/.radicle/bin:$PATH"` to your shell configuration
- Restart your shell
- Check that the remote helper is available in your path by running:

```
$ which git-remote-rad
<home path>/.radicle/bin/git-remote-rad
```

With the remote helper installed, you will be able to [push changes][pc] from
your working copies to your Radicle [monorepo][ri] or [fetch changes][fc] from
other peers via the `rad` remote. The Radicle Upstream client then publishes
these changes to the Radicle network.

To start using Radicle, continue on to the [Using Radicle][ur] section.
