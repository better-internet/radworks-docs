## Download & Installation

The Radicle network can be accessed via Upstream, a desktop client. To download
the app, click [here][bk]. While Upstream is currently the only client for
using Radicle, it won't be the only one. Upstream development is public by
default and completely open source. You can follow along development on
[radicle.community][co].

Radicle Upstream is available for download on Linux and macOS. If you are
installing on a [Mac computer with Apple Silicon ][as] please note that you may
experience issues as Radicle Upstream has not been tested on the Apple Silicon
platform.

Once you've downloaded the app for your respective platform, start it like
this:

#### On Linux:

1. make the package executable with: `chmod +x radicle-upstream-X.X.X.AppImage`
2. start the app: `./radicle-upstream-X.X.X.AppImage`

#### On macOS:

Open the `radicle-upstream-x.x.x.dmg` package and install Upstream by dragging
the `Radicle Upstream` binary to the `/Applications` folder.

  <source src="/img/macOS-install.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

**Note**: before you can start Upstream for the first time, you'll have to
perform some extra steps. This is because we haven't set up
[Apple notarization][an] for Upstream yet, read more about it [here][aw].
You'll only have to do this once -- the first time you launch the app.

While we will be participating in the Apple Developer Program to ensure
accessibility to our macOS users, we do not agree with Apple's financial
gatekeeping and increasing control over application distribution on their
platform. Forcing developers to "pay-to-play" under the guise of a security
solution is an extractive form of vendor lock-in that inhibits the growth and
accessibility of open software.

1. Open `/Applications` in finder, locate the `Radicle Upstream` app and
   right-click it, then select `Open` from the context menu. You should see a
   dialog with two buttons `Move to Bin` and `Cancel`.

2. Dismiss the dialog by clicking `Cancel` to bypass macOS security measures
   which disallow running unsigned binaries. Repeat the previous step. You
   should now see three buttons: `Move to Bin`, `Open` and `Cancel`, click `Open`.

## Creating an identity

To create an identity on the Radicle network, you can use the Upstream app. The
app will generate a unique identifier â€” known as a [**Device ID**][di] â€” that's
paired to the computer you've installed Radicle on. For now, this Device ID is
the only way other users can find and collaborate with you. Later on, you will
be able to manage multiple Device IDs under one user handle, enabling support
and consistency across multiple devices.

![Identity][id]

The app will also prompt you to create a passphrase. This passphrase *isn't* a
private key â€” it is a password decrypting your keypair to access and publish to
the Upstream app. You will also be prompted for this passphrase when pushing
and fetching code from your local machine to the Radicle network via your
command line.

## Configuring your system

To publish code to the Radicle network via the Upstream client, you first have
to add the [Radicle git remote helper][rg] to your shell configuration.

- Add `export PATH="$HOME/.radicle/bin:$PATH"` to your shell configuration
- Restart your shell
- Check that the remote helper is available in your path by running:

```
$ which git-remote-rad
<home path>/.radicle/bin/git-remote-rad
```

With the remote helper installed, you will be able to [push changes][pc] to
your [Radicle installation][ri], which will be published by the Upstream
client.

## Adding a seed node to Upstream

Seed nodes are "always-on" nodes running on public IP addresses that serve data
to connected peers. By adding a seed to Upstream, that seed automatically
tracks you and shares your data across its network of other connected peers
[^1]. This increases the availability of your data throughout the network,
while making it easier to find other's data as well. Upstream is preconfigured
with a Radicle operated seed to bootstrap your connectivity. If you have
removed the default seed, you can always re-add it later by following these
steps:

1. Navigate to *Settings*. There, under the *Network* header, you'll find your
   seed list.
2. Paste the seed address into the input box and submit by pressing
   <kbd>RETURN</kbd>.

    `hynewpywqj6x4mxgj7sojhue3erucyexiyhobxx4du9w66hxhbfqbw@seedling.radicle.xyz:12345`

3. Check that you're connected by hovering over your Connection icon in your
   Homebar.

Recent activity and connected peers on the Radicle network can be viewed at
http://seedling.radicle.xyz/.

To learn how to use Radicle, head over to the [Collaborating on Radicle][cr]
section.


[^1]: Seed nodes can be configured to either track and share all data across
      the network, or to propagate only a specific set of peers or projects.
      Please refer to your seed operator for details. If you're running your
      own seed, have a look at the [Running a seed node][sn] section and the
      [seed node documentation][sd].
