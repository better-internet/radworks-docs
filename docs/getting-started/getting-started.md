## Installation & Download

The Radicle network can be accessed via Upstream, a desktop client. To download the app, click [here](https://buildkite.com/monadic/radicle-upstream/builds/6098). While Upstream is currently the only client for using Radicle, it won't be the only one. Upstream development is public by default and completely open source. You can follow along development on [radicle.community](https://radicle.community)

## Creating an identity

To create an identity on the Radicle network, you can use the Upstream app. The app will generate a unique identifier â€” known as a [**Device ID**](understanding-radicle/glossary.md/#peerid) â€” that's paired to the computer you've installed Radicle on. For now, this Device ID is the only way other users can find and collaborate with you. Later on, you will be able to manage multiple Device IDs under one user handle, enabling support and consistency across multiple devices.

The app will also prompt you to create a passphrase. This passphrase *isn't* a private key â€” it is a password decrypting your keypair to access and publish to the Upstream app. You will also be prompted for this passphrase when pushing and fetching code from your local machine to the Radicle network via your command line.

## Configuring your system

To publish code to the Radicle network via the Upstream client, you first have to add the [Radicle git remote helper](understanding-radicle/faq.md) to your shell configuration.

- Add `export PATH="$HOME/.radicle/bin:$PATH"` to your shell configuration
- Restart your shell
- Check that the remote helper is available in your path by running:

```
$ which git-remote-rad
<home path>/.radicle/bin/git-remote-rad
```

With the remote helper installed, you will be able to [push changes](using-radicle/pushing-and-pulling-changes.md#pushing-changes-to-a-project) to your [Radicle installation](understanding-radicle/how-it-works.md), which will be published by the Upstream client.

## Joining a seed node

Seed nodes are "always-on" nodes running on public IPs that serve data to any connected peers. By joining a seed node, it automatically tracks you and shares your data across it's network of other connected users. This increases the availability of your data throughout the network, while making it easier to find other's data as well. We recommend joining the official Radicle seed node to bootstrap your connectivity.

1. Navigate to *Settings*. There, under the *Network* header, you'll find your seed list.
2. Add the seed address to the input box and submit by pressing `RETURN`

    `hybh5cb7spafgs7skjg6qkssts3uxht31zskpgs4ypdzrnaq7ye83k@seedling.radicle.xyz:12345`

3. Check that you're connected by hovering over your Connection icon in your Homebar.
