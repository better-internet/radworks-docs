You can obtain Rad token from a number of sources, including but not limited to
the following places. None of these sources are endorsed by the Radicle project.

### Distributed exchanges

### When will Rad be listed on my preferred exchange?

For legal reasons Radicle team cannot apply for / encourage listings. If you're
interested in a listing on a specific exchange, you can ask the exchange
yourself. Trading on other exchanges also increases the overall order volume and
makes the token listing more likely in new places.
