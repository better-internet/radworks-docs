## Overview

The Radicle project has always navigated a “dual product vision” (e.g. decentralized code collab & funding for open source). While attempts were made to build under a cohesive product vision (e.g. Upstream, Radicle Funding), it was decided by the teams that the best way forward is to lead their own individual paths to “product-market fit” and adoption. Read more about the evolution of this split here.

Radicle (code collab) has seen many phases and types of protocols over the years. Starting off development on IPFS, it quickly became clear that it would be too slow for what the team was trying to achieve. In 2019 there was a pivot to developing the Link protocol, built on xxx, and the creation of Upstream which was built on Ethereum.  Both protocols struggled to meet the needs of users, which led to a pivot towards a whole new protocol, Heartwood, in April 2022. The Heartwood protocol……

Drips is fulfilling the second part of the original mission to build and maintain resilient, decentralized tools that create new and sustainable value flows for FOSS developers. This “sustainable funding” initiative has also seen many iterations. Starting with OSCoin, a currency that was intended to be used on the code collab platform,.....


## Decentralization of the Project

From its inception, Radicle was envisioned as a new kind of open-source project — one built, governed, and financed on the internet and is community owned and driven. Over the past few years, the team has been deploying the technical, economic, and social foundations necessary to achieve this vision.

Decentralization of the project started with the creation of the Radicle Foundation and deployment of the RAD governance token & initial governance process in early 2021. This was the first step towards the creation of the DAO and handing over POWER to contributors and users to the project. In this first phase of decentralization, the Foundation still funded and managed most core Radicle development and their core teams. The RAD token ensured a health treasury to start funding development and initiatives from. Starting in April of 2023, core development teams, now organized into Orgs, are being funded directly from the DAO and the Foundation acts more as a support vessel to these Orgs.
