In 2017, a group of technologists set out to re-imagine free and open source software collaboration with protocols, not
platforms. They started [Monadic](https://web.archive.org/web/20210316075436/http://monadic.xyz/), a Berlin-based
software company with a home base in the heart of Kreuzberg. Monadic spawned the open source projects
[Radicle](https://web.archive.org/web/20191220202701/http://www.radicle.xyz/) and [oscoin](http://oscoin.io/) that from
inception, were both meant to become a new kind of open-source project — built, governed, and financed on the internet.
Over the next couple of years, the projects merged, and became known as solely the Radicle project. 

In 2021, the team began the decentralization of the project with the initialization of the network’s native governance
token ($RAD). With this, the RadicleDAO was formed, granting the community of $RAD holders the ability to make decisions
on how to govern the project’s Treasury and smart contracts. All Monadic contributors transitioned to the Radicle
Foundation, a Swiss entity formed in 2020 to support the development of resilient and humane software infrastructures,
such as Radicle.

The Foundation funded and coordinated all core development of the Radicle project up until May 2023, when the project
split into two products: Radicle (code-collaboration) and Drips (drip-down funding). Both products were successfully
spun out into their own, autonomous entities - known as "Orgs" - which are directly supported by the DAO - now known as
Radworks. Today, the community continues to collectively govern the Radworks treasury, funding Orgs that do work in line
with the Radworks purpose.

## A History of Radworks

The Berlin-based, venture-backed entity that supported the early stages of the project.

### September, 2018: [Radicle](https://web.archive.org/web/20180914083434/http://radicle.xyz/), a language for peer-to-peer collaboration, is created

A language developed to be the basis of [open source coin](https://web.archive.org/web/20180914083434/http://oscoin.io/).

### February, 2019: Radicle (code collab) [launches in alpha](https://web.archive.org/web/20190314142514/http://www.radicle.xyz/)

The initial version of the code collaboration platform that was built on IPFS.

### March, 2019: [Oscoin whitepaper](https://github.com/oscoin/whitepaper) is released

The whitepaper formally defined the oscoin protocol and network.

### June, 2020: Radicle Foundation is established

A Swiss Foundation that acts as Radworks’ trusted real-world entity that stewards the progressively decentralization of the project.

### August, 2020: Oscoin merges under the Radicle brand

The project combines a dual-market vision - decentralized code collab & funding for open source - under one roof.

### December, 2020: [Radicle Upstream](https://twitter.com/radicle/status/1333403629961797635?s=20) is released in beta

A desktop application built on Radicle. 

### February, 2021: [$RAD launches](https://radicle.mirror.xyz/CgcHpSXUlPvwMVaUVVaJ7r8bIJI2BOKOytaI9-nO9oY)

With this, the RadicleDAO is established and [v1 of the Radicle Governance Process](https://radicle.community/t/archive-radicle-governance-process/526/6) is released.

### July, 2021: Contributors transition to the Radicle Foundation, Monadic is dissolved

All core contributors who were previously employed via Monadic began contracting with the Radicle Foundation.

### January, 2022: The [Drips Project](https://www.drips.network/) is born

A decentralized, token streaming tool-kit that allows anyone to generate ongoing support using subscriptions and NFT memberships.

### January, 2022: The DAO funds the [Radicle Grants Program](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants)

With the passing of the [Radicle Grants Wave 1 proposal](https://boardroom.io/radicle/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6cmFkaWNsZTpvbmNoYWluOjU=), the Grants Program started to find, fund, and guide research and development of any projects within the Radicle ecosystem.

### February, 2022: Radicle launches [a web client](https://twitter.com/radicle/status/1497209699959250948)

The Radicle network moves to the web, with a CLI and complementing web interface.

### March, 2022: [Ecosystem Growth Fund](https://boardroom.io/radicle/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6cmFkaWNsZTpvbmNoYWluOjc=) proposal passes

The Radicle Ecosystem Growth Fund (EGF) was set up to fund initiatives that drive awareness, engagement, and adoption of the Radicle stack.

### April, 2022: The project begins its [“transition to the DAO”](https://radicle.community/t/the-next-phase-of-the-radicledao/2776)

A coordinated effort defined by four workstreams to transition funding & coordination of core development from the Radicle Foundation to the community. 

### July, 2022: Radicle Upstream is [deprecated](https://radicle.community/t/upstream-july-2022-community-update/2962), Radicle team starts building new [Heartwood protocol](https://github.com/radicle-dev/heartwood)

Upstream is sunset to shift focus to the web client. The Radicle team starts re-architecting the third iteration of the Radicle Protocol: Heartwood.

### September, 2022: [Radicle Foundation becomes fully DAO-funded](https://radicle.community/t/11-phase-0-transition-to-the-dao/3026)

The Foundation — which was funding & coordinating core development work of the Radicle project independently from the DAO — comes under the purview of DAO governance. This completes the first phase of the [project’s “transition to the DAO”](https://radicle.community/t/the-next-phase-of-the-radicledao/2776). 

### November, 2022: [Wrapping up of the Ecosystem Growth Fund](https://radicle.community/t/ecosystem-growth-fund-retrospective/3131)

The EGF is sunset until a clearer path towards PMF for development teams is apparent.

### April, 2023:  Heartwood launches

The [Heartwood protocol](https://app.radicle.xyz/seeds/seed.radicle.xyz/rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5) [launches in April 2023](https://twitter.com/radicle/status/1648336183468933122?s=20) and addresses usability and performance concerns we faced during the previous iterations of the protocol, while doubling down on Radicle's secure and resilient primitives.

### May 2023: All core work is transitioned to the DAO, [sunsetting of DAO transition work](https://radicle.community/t/wrapping-up-the-org-design-wg/3320/3)

[Radicle](https://boardroom.io/radicle/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6cmFkaWNsZTpvbmNoYWluOjE0) and [Drips](https://boardroom.io/radicle/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6cmFkaWNsZTpvbmNoYWluOjE1) and [Grants](https://radicle.community/t/formal-review-rgp-13-start-the-grants-org/3305/4) became independent, DAO-funded Orgs within the DAO and the [Org Design Working Group](https://radicle.community/t/open-call-core-development-org-design-working-group/3042/3), which led the charge of DAO transition design & research, was sunset.
