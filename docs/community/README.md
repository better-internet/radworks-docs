Welcome to the Radicle Community Hub!

## Join the project

### GitHub

All Radicle development is open-source and public by default. The `radicle-dev` GitHub account is consistently active
and is the best place to see what the team is working on until Radicle itself has features like issues, patches, and
CI/CD.

## Join the discussion

### Discord

Most conversations in the community are happening here. The core team is very active and typically responds to questions
in real time.

### Discourse

The hub for all longer-form discussions about the project. The team uses it regularly to share project-wide
announcements, releases, feature updates, and more.

### Matrix

Some of the core team uses Matrix, and the Discord channels are mirrored here. Information on Matrix is almost the same
as Discord.

## Stay up to date

### Twitter

We use Twitter to share announcements and project-wide updates, as well as amplify Radicle-aligned messaging from
partnerships and the greater ecosystem. We don't offer support here.
