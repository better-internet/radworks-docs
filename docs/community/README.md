# What is RADWorks?

## Our Purpose
RADWorks funds new, resilient, permissionless technologies to cultivate internet freedom. We focus on funding and supporting the creation of censorship-resistant and decentralized technologies that empower builders and creators to collaborate. We strive to endorse and provide resources to builders of these technologies. We are committed to enabling individuals and communities to collaborate in the digital realm securely and freely. 

Radworks is committed to transparency, inclusivity, and decentralized decision-making, ensuring that our community has a say in the direction of our efforts and the projects we support. Together, we can build a more decentralized and equitable future for software development.
