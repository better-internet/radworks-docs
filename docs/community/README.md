# What is RADWorks?

## Our Purpose
We believe that the future of software development lies in decentralized technologies and that a community-driven approach is the key to building truly innovative and sustainable solutions. By providing a platform for collaboration and funding, we aim to empower developers to create tools and projects that promote decentralization, security, and accessibility for all. 

Radworks is committed to transparency, inclusivity, and decentralized decision-making, ensuring that our community has a say in the direction of our efforts and the projects we support. Together, we can build a more decentralized and equitable future for software development.
