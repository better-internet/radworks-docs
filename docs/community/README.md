Welcome to the RadicleDAO community hub! Here you'll find ecosystem-wide resources, guidelines, and docs relevant for
anyone who wants to participate in our community, whether that's [joining development](https://github.com/radicle-dev),
[watching Community Calls](community/calls.md), or [joining a community channel](#join-the-discussion). This hub is
currently maintained by the Community & Governance team.

:::note

We're currently working on migrating and organizing community-related information from many disparate sources. ðŸš§ Please
excuse the dust. ðŸš§

    All Radicle development is open-source and public by default. The `radicle-dev` GitHub account is consistently active and is the best place to see what the team is working on until Radicle itself has features like issues, patches, and CI/CD.
