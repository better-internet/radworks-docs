# What is Radworks?

In a world that almost entirely relies on software, maintaining the resilience and health of the free and open source ecosystem is more important than ever.

Radworks is building a sovereign developer stack that enables developers to securely host, collaborate, and reward open-source code. It operates as a community-governed network that uses both and off- and on-chain governance mechanisms to make decisions as a community. 

See [here](https://docs.radworks.org/community/governance-overview) for more information on our governance.

## Purpose

> Radworks focuses on funding and supporting the creation of censorship-resistant and decentralized technologies that empower builders and creators to collaborate.

> Radworks is committed to transparency, inclusivity, and decentralized decision-making, ensuring that the community has a say in the direction of its efforts and the projects it supports. Together, the Radworks community can build a more decentralized and equitable future for software development. 

> The community-madated purpose lives [here](https://app.radicle.xyz/seeds/seed.radworks.org/rad:zPUsinVa3gP71g6Dt47LP76phAWd/tree/main/purpose.md).
