Welcome to the Radicle Community Hub!

We're currently migrating community resources here, beginning with [governance documentation](/governance). In the
meantime, please excuse our dust.

## Get involved

To get involved with Radicle project, start by joining our community channels:

### [Discord](https://discord.gg/j2HZCBDUvF)

Most conversations in the community are happening here. The core team is very active and typically responds to questions
in real time.

[discord.com](https://discord.gg/dZK4TxaU2v)

### [Discourse](https://radicle.community/)

The hub for all longer-form discussions about the project. The team uses it regularly to share project-wide
announcements, releases, feature updates, and more.

### Newsletters

[**Radicle Digest**](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/radicle): Monthly updates from the future of sovereign code
collaboration over peer-to-peer networks, designed to keep those who aren't following Discord constantly up to speed
with the latest product news and updates.

[**Radicle Governance Updates**](http://eepurl.com/hhHxMX): Get updates on the latest [governance](/governance) news for
RAD holders and delegates, including links to active proposals, governance team updates, and highlights exciting
activity to keep an eye out for in coming weeks. 

### [GitHub](https://github.com/radicle-dev)

All Radicle development is open-source and public by default. The `radicle-dev` GitHub account is consistently active
and is the best place to see what the team is working on until Radicle itself has features like issues, patches, and
CI/CD.

### [Twitter](https://twitter.com/radicle)

We use Twitter to share announcements and project-wide updates, as well as amplify Radicle-aligned messaging from
partnerships and the greater ecosystem. We don't offer support here.

### [Matrix](https://matrix.radicle.community/)

Some of the core team uses Matrix, and the Discord channels are mirrored here. Information on Matrix is almost the same
as Discord.

Larger announcements are posted in our official Telegram channel. There are also other channels sprouting up which are
quite active.
