# What is Radworks?

In a world that almost entirely relies on software, maintaining the resilience and health of the free and open source ecosystem is more important than ever. We strive to demonstrate the viability — in cost, labor, quality, and resiliency — of open-source software and its development.

Radworks is building a sovereign developer stack that enables developers to securely host, collaborate, and reward open-source code. It operates as a community-governed network that uses both and off- and on-chain governance mechanisms to make decisions as a community. 

See the “Overview” section for more information on our governance.

## Purpose

> Radworks funds new, resilient, permissionless technologies to cultivate internet freedom. We focus on funding and supporting the creation of censorship-resistant and decentralized technologies that empower builders and creators to collaborate. We strive to endorse and provide resources to builders of these technologies. 

> Radworks is committed to transparency, inclusivity, and decentralized decision-making, ensuring that our community has a say in the direction of our efforts and the projects we support. Together, we can build a more decentralized and equitable future for software development. 

> Our purpose lives [here](https://app.radicle.xyz/seeds/seed.radworks.org/rad:zPUsinVa3gP71g6Dt47LP76phAWd/tree/main/purpose.md).


Radworks is run by a decentralized governance system, powered by its community of users & builders, and represented by the $RAD token. Read more about [Radworks governance](/community/governance-overview).
