# How We Work

Radworks is composed of **Orgs**. Orgs represent different groups of contributors that are funded from its treasury. Orgs serve the Radworks purpose by building technologies for developers that cultivate internet freedom. To obtain funding, Orgs must pass annual budget proposals through Radworks governance (see [Governance Manual](https://github.com/radicle-foundation/radworks-governance/blob/main/manual.md)).

All Orgs have the autonomy to choose their own governance models, manage their own funds and run their own organizations. Each Org is required to participate in quarterly community calls and report to the community on their progress on the objectives  outlined in their annual funding proposals.

Currently, Radworks funds **four** separate Orgs: Radicle, Drips, Radworks Product, and Foundation. 

## Radicle Org

The Radicle Org aims to develop a fully-sovereign code collaboration stack called “Radicle”.
[Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) is designed to be a secure, decentralized and powerful alternative to code forges such
as GitHub and GitLab while preserving user sovereignty and freedom. See the Radicle Org's [community approved strategy & budget for 2025](https://community.radworks.org/t/formal-review-radicle-org-proposal-2025/3613).

## Drips Org

The Drips Org’s mission is to enable FOSS developers to financially thrive by taking on the problem of [FOSS
sustainability](https://fosssustainability.com/) / funding public goods. [Drips](https://www.drips.network/) develops
novel [protocols](https://github.com/radicle-dev/drips-contracts), tools and applications that enable new value flows
for developers in order to receive funds from their users and supporters. See the Drips Org's [community approved strategy & budget for 2025](https://community.radworks.org/t/formal-review-drips-org-proposal-2025/3614).

## Radworks Product Org

The Radworks Product Org's mission is to popularize the Radicle sovereign developer stack and prove new business models around it. Radworks Product brings together efforts from the RSN and the current Radicle Desktop client, with the goal to develop a coherent product experience. See the Radworks Product Org's [community approved strategy and budget for 2025](https://community.radworks.org/t/formal-review-radworks-product-org-proposal-2025/3612).

## Foundation Org

The Foundation Org is represented by the [Better Internet Foundation](https://betterinternet.foundation/) (previously Radicle Foundation) - a Swiss non-profit entity. The Foundation's purpose is to support projects and people developing resilient, non-extractive peer-to-peer technologies that promote Internet freedom. In its role as protector of the Ecosystem, the Foundation stewards identification and responses to Org-specific and Ecosystem-wide needs and risks in an increasingly evolving regulatory environment. See the Foundation Org's [community approved strategy and budget for 2025](https://community.radworks.org/t/formal-review-foundation-org-proposal-2025/3611).

> The Better Internet Foundation does not control treasury funds, nor can it direct product development of Radicle, Drips, and Radworks Product.
