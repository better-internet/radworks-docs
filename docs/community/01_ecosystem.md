title: Ecosystem

Radworks is composed of **Orgs**. Orgs represent different groups of contributors that are funded from its treasury. To obtain funding, Orgs must pass annual budget proposals through Radworks governance. Orgs serve the Radworks purpose by building technologies for developers that cultivate internet freedom. 

All Orgs have the autonomy to choose their own governance models, manage their own funds and run their own organizations. Each Org is required to participate in quarterly community calls and report to the community on their progress on the objectives  outlined in their annual funding proposals.

Currently, Radworks funds four separate Orgs:

## Radicle Org
The Radicle Org aims to develop a fully-sovereign code collaboration stack called “Radicle”. [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) is designed to be a secure, decentralized and powerful alternative to code forges such as GitHub and GitLab while preserving user sovereignty and freedom.

## Drips Org
The Drips Org’s mission is to enable FOSS developers to financially thrive by taking on the problem of [FOSS
sustainability](https://fosssustainability.com/) and funding public goods. It develops [Drips](https://www.drips.network/), a peer-to-peer fund sharing and splitting solution built on Ethereum.

## Radicle Foundation Org
The Radicle Foundation provides operations, marketing, and governance support to Radworks and its Orgs. It also fulfills roles that are better suited to a legal entity, such as the maintenance of Radworks’ intellectual property and initiation of Radworks’ legal analysis and action.

## Grants Org
The [Radworks Grants](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants) Org’s aim is to extend the Radworks ecosystem. It finds, funds, and guides research and development of any FOSS projects that fall outside the purview of currently funded product/engineering orgs (e.g. Radicle, Drips).
