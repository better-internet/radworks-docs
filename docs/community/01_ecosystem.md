The DAO is organized into subDAOs that we call **Orgs**. These Orgs are made up of teams which are composed of various contributors. Each Org is independent and obtains funding by posting annual proposals that include purpose, initiatives, budget and governance structure.

We created an organizational design that enables the autonomy of the product/engineering teams (Radicle and Drips) while continuing to support the emergence of the service teams (Marketing, Community, Operations). In that light, below is the revised proposed plan of action to support this org shift during the transition to the DAO.

The Radicle (code collab) and Drips (funding) product/engineering teams are their own separate Orgs. Each has their own governance model and manages their own funds. They are predominantly product/engineering Orgs, but have the autonomy to hire non-product/engineering roles if expertise is needed outside of the services other Orgs provide.

The Foundation Org’s purpose has been and will continue to be “to support the development of resilient and humane software infrastructures…[and] to fund projects and people that develop non-extractive peer-to-peer technologies that promote internet freedom.” In line with this purpose, it will work on the continued decentralization of the DAO and coordinate and organize the “support teams” required by the Radicle and Drips Orgs. These support teams — or committees — will initially be Marketing, Operations, and Governance. These domain-specific functions will not only focus on Radicle and Drips but conduct work in support of the DAO and its other Orgs, such as Grants. Orgs like Radicle & Drips will work closely with these function areas to define their needs and the deliverables best suited to support the goals of the Orgs and the DAO. Once a support teams is mature enough to operate autonomously within the DAO, they can be spun out into their own independent Org similar to Radicle and Drips.
