Radworks is composed of **Orgs**. Orgs represent different groups of contributors serving the Radworks purpose and are funded from its treasury. To obtain funding, Orgs must pass annual budget proposals through Radworks governance.

Currently, Radworks funds four separate Orgs:

## Radicle Org

The Radicle Org aims to develop a fully-sovereign code collaboration stack called “Radicle”.
[Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) is designed to be a secure, decentralized and powerful alternative to code forges such
as GitHub and GitLab while preserving user sovereignty and freedom.

## Drips Org

The Drips Org’s mission is to enable FOSS developers to financially thrive by taking on the problem of [FOSS
sustainability](https://fosssustainability.com/) / funding public goods. [Drips](https://www.drips.network/) develops
novel [protocols](https://github.com/radicle-dev/drips-contracts), tools and applications that enable new value flows
for developers in order to receive funds from their users and supporters.

## Radicle Foundation Org

The Radicle Foundation provides operations, marketing, and governance support to Radworks and its Orgs. It also fulfills
roles that are better suited to a legal entity, such as the maintenance of RadicleDAO’s intellectual property and
initiation of RadicleDAO’s legal analysis and action.

## Grants Org

The [Radworks Grants](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-grants) Org finds, funds, and guides research and
development of any FOSS projects that fall outside the purview of currently funded product/engineering orgs (e.g.
Radicle, Drips).
