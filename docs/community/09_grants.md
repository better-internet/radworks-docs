# Radworks Grants Program
The Radworks Grants program is used to support open source initives that support the development of the Radworks ecosystem. Specifically, the Grants program focuses on funding:  
- Additions to core Radicle software or components of Web3 infrastructure that interact with the Radicle stack
- Additions to core Drips software or components, or compelling adoption of tooling, such as Radicle Drips SDK
- Initiatives furthering the adoption of Radicle & Drips

Most grants distributed via the Grants program fall between XX-XX USDC/RAD. All grant applications are reviewed by the Grants Committee - a group of trusted ecosystem participants. Grants are distributed using Drips on a milestone-based schedule.
