# Radworks Grants Program
The Radworks Grants program is used to support open source initiatives that support the development of the Radworks ecosystem. Specifically, the Grants program focuses on funding:  
- Software or components that extend or interact with the Radicle stack
- Software, components or apps that extend or innteract with the Drips protocol
- Initiatives that further the adoption of Radicle & Drips

Most grants distributed via the Grants program fall between 2,000-50,000 USDC/RAD. All grant applications are reviewed by the Grants Committee - a group of trusted ecosystem participants. Grants are distributed using Drips on a milestone-based schedule.
