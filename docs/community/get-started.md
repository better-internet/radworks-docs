title: Getting Started
---

Here‚Äôs a quickstart guide on how to participate in Radicle governance.

## Creating a proposal

To propose a Governance Proposal to the DAO, it must make its way through the public community review process. Please
refer to the [**Governance Manual**](manual-overview.md) for a full description of how to get started with creating a
proposal.

:::note

The individual(s) who create a proposal are known as the proposal ‚ÄúChampions.‚Äù They are expected to escalate proposals
from phase to phase, with guidance from community moderators. This also means they are responsible for creating forum
posts for each stage.

## Voting on existing proposals

Voting in on-chain token governance requires $RAD, the project‚Äôs native governance token. To obtain $RAD, you can follow
[these steps](obtain-rad.md). One $RAD token is equal to one vote and all voting rounds require a minimum participation
threshold of 4M RAD (4% of total $RAD supply). If participation thresholds are met, proposals are passed by obtaining a
majority ‚Äúin-favor‚Äù votes.

Voting takes place both on- and off-chain:

- Formal Reviews: Off-chain consensus checks are done via Snapshot polls.
- Governance Proposals: Token voting for on-chain proposals take place on the Radicle Governance Portal.

**You can keep track of all open proposals and vote directly on the [Radicle Governance
Portal](https://boardroom.io/radicle/overview). üå± üèõÔ∏è**

## Delegation

On-chain voting is enabled by delegating voting rights to the address (or addresses) of the token holder's choice:

- The owner‚Äôs own wallet, if they would like to vote on their own.
- Another user's wallet, if they would like the other user to vote on their behalf.
- No wallet, if they don't want to vote.

Delegation takes place on-chain (e.g. via Boardroom or Tally). After connecting a wallet holding $RAD, you are then able
to delegate to either yourself or others. If you are delegating to yourself, after the delegation process is complete
you are able to participate in on-chain voting. If you are delegating to others, they will received the amount you
delegate as voting power to participate in on-chain voting.

:::note

Any delegation made on-chain will be mirrored to Snapshot for off-chain votes - i.e. any $RAD that is delegated to your
wallet on-chain will be able to be able to be used to vote in off-chain Snapshot polls.

### Delegate Types

There are two types of delegates in the RadicleDAO governance process - a regular delegate and an ‚ÄúActive Delegate‚Äù. The
main difference between the two is the Active Delegates have shared a more detailed profile of their expertise,
governance values and conflicts of interest on the Active Delegate Platform and have committed to share their thoughts
on each proposal so token holders are better able to assess  who they would like to delegate to. 

You **DO NOT** have to announce yourself as an¬†Active Delegate for someone to delegate to your address. The Active
Delegate Platform is meant to provide an opportunity for motivated community members to make themselves known to the
broader Radicle community to let token holders know they are happy to vote on their behalf.

**How to become a Delegate:**

- Verify and announce your delegate address via [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/radicle) or [Boardroom](https://boardroom.io/radicle/proposals).

**How to become an Active Delegate:**

- Please read the [Radicle Active Delegate Announcement Process &
    Platform](https://radicle.community/t/radicle-active-delegate-announcement-process-platform/2669) post for further
    details on the platform and goals behind it.
- Follow the steps explained here: [Radicle Delegate Announcement
  Process](https://radicle.community/t/radicle-delegate-announcement-process/2668)

## Never miss a vote!

The best way to get live governance updates is by following the RadicleDAO Governance Twitter
([@rad_gov](https://twitter.com/rad_gov)) or follow the [üèõÔ∏ègovernance-updates channel](https://discord.com/channels/841318878125490186/955793826264514560) on Discord. These accounts act as
governance ‚Äúticker‚Äù accounts and include all of the information and links needed to participate in voting. You can also
set up [email notifications](https://app.tango.us/app/workflow/Email-Notifications-ac8d8e2eff5746f48ebd17e1f6b2b6ff) directly from the the calendar on our [Boardroom governance portal](https://boardroom.io/radicle/overview). 

The *Radicle Governance Updates* newsletter is a bi-weekly newsletter that provides updates on recent proposals, what
the governance team is focusing on, as well as event and other reminders. You can [subscribe

## Tooling Glossary

Here's a quick breakdown of the tools Radicle uses for governance:

- [Boardroom](https://boardroom.io/radicle/): Our primary portal for decentralized governance, including on-chain
  voting.
- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/gov.radicle.eth): Used for off-chain consensus checks on proposals working through
  the governance process.
- [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/eip155:1:0x690e775361AD66D1c4A25d89da9fCd639F5198eD): An alternative proposal
  creation and voting platform, which pulls from same contracts as Boardroom.
