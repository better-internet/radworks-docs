title: Radicle Treasury
---

Governance is also employed to manage the [Radicle
Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8da8f82d2bbdd896822de723f55d6edf416130ba#tokentxns), a community owned and
governed pool of capital for developing and growing the Radicle network and community. Because the Treasury is an asset
of [RadicleDAO](transition-dao.md), its community of token holders can propose, vote on, and implement initiatives that
make Radicle a core piece of internet infrastructure. The Radicle Treasury will fund the maintenance, development, and
growth of the Radicle network and its participants in perpetuity.
