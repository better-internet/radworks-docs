## [BROWSE COMMUNITY CHANNELS & FORUMS](https://radworks.org)

### Community Calls
Community Calls are held on a quarterly basis. Each Org is responsible for sending one team member to present a progress update on what they are working on and what they have planned for the coming quarter. This is an opportunity for Orgs to touch base with each other and for our community to see what's happening within the project.

More detailed and frequent updates from each of the Orgs can be found **TBD**.

#### Archive
In the past, Community Calls happened on a monthly basis. Each core team presented updates and notes, relevant links and the recordings were curated by the Community & Governance team. A full collection of video recordings of our past and current Community Calls can be found on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUUjDC9sOrplFcqQxhgQGKRXKMSqJ_wOZ).

### Proposal Reviews
Proposal Reviews take place every second Wednesday of each month. These calls are used as a space for proposal authors who have proposals going up for vote that month to discuss their proposals and answer questions from the community. You can find the link for upcoming calls on Discord by the 1st of each month.

More detailed updates to governance work being done can be found in the monthly written updates on the forum. The Governance Committee will also present quarterly goals & reflections during the Quarterly Community Calls.

#### Archive
Governance calls in the past went into a lot more detail of on-going governance work and initiatives. With the introduction of the new proposal cycle from the [Governance Improvements Proposal](https://radicle.community/t/formal-review-governance-improvements-proposal/3270/5), the transition to proposal-focused Proposal Review calls made more sense to make these calls the most effective for the community. Past governance call notes & recordings can be found [here](https://forest-text-046.notion.site/Monthly-RadicleDAO-Governance-Calls-Notes-Recordings-643bc0e48361486a866a114ead555cdd).
