title: The RAD Token
---

$RAD is the native token of the Radworks Network, used as the primary means to coordinate all actors, govern the treasury, and reward infrastructure providers on top of the Radicle network.

# How it works

## Governance 
Radworks is a community-run network in which all aspects are governed by RAD holders. RAD holders can vote on Radworks Governance Proposals (RGPs) to distribute funds from the Treasury, improve the network, and manage critical system parameters.

For legal reasons, the Radworks team cannot apply for or encourage listings. If you're interested in a listing on a specific exchange, you can ask the exchange yourself. Trading on other exchanges also increases the overall order volume and makes the token listing more likely in new places.

## Roadmap - Coming Soon!
There is an ongoing effort to bring new token utility to Radworks and the RAD token. These features will generate value for the network by funding critical incentives that will support network growth and development around the Radicle network.
