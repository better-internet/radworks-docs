$RAD is the native governance token for Radicle. It can be obtained from a number of sources, including decentralized exchanges (e.g. Uniswap) and various centralized exchanges (e.g. Coinbase).

For legal reasons, the Radworks team cannot apply for or encourage listings. If you're interested in a listing on a specific exchange, you can ask the exchange yourself. Trading on other exchanges also increases the overall order volume and makes the token listing more likely in new places.
