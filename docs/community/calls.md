import Collapse from '@site/src/components/Collapse'

On the last Wednesday of every month, the Radicle project hosts a **Radicle Community Call**. Each Core Team is
responsible for sending one team member to present a progress update on what they are working on. This is an opportunity
for our community to see what's happening within the project.

## Notes &amp; recordings

This is a collection of all monthly Community Call notes that are currently being curated by our Governance Facilitator,
Shelby. These notes can be posted with each video and should include timestamps to relevant sections of the video. Links
to all recordings are included under each month. A full collection video recordings of our Community Calls can be found
on our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUUjDC9sOrplFcqQxhgQGKRXKMSqJ_wOZ) playlist.

Thanks for joining this month’s community call! Below is a collection of all written updates from each core team shared in the call. 

ℹ️ If you have not let, please read these two important community-wide updates: 
[An Evolution of Radicle’s Brand(s)](https://radicle.community/t/an-evolution-of-radicle-s-brand-s/3224)
[An Evolution of Radicle’s Orgs](https://radicle.community/t/org-design-update-an-evolution-of-radicle-s-org-s/3248)

**Community Call Update**

We will transition to a quarterly **DAO Community Call**, that features updates from all Orgs. The goal of this quarterly call is to be a checkpoint between the DAO and its Orgs, while giving the RadicleDAO community a look into what’s happening in the ecosystem. Orgs can choose to host their own monthly community calls moving forward.

This call will happen at the end of every quarter (last week of March, June, September, and December [before holidays]). The first quarterly call will be held on **March 29th, in replacement of our monthly community call.**

#### **Monthly Calls to Quarterly Calls** (01:00)

We  have transitioned from monthly Community Calls to a quarterly cadence. The purpose of Quarterly Calls is to give Orgs a touchpoint with each other and give the DAO a touchpoint with its Orgs. These calls will be an opportunity to sync and share important ecosystem-wide updates and provide higher-level announcements & demos. 

The exact format for these calls going forward still TBD, but all Orgs & Org Committees will have a chance to present updates. We are planning to continue requiring a written update from each Org to post to the forum for a written record of quarterly updates.

### 2022

<Collapse title="January Community Call" date="26 January 2022">

📹 There is unfortunately NO RECORDING for this month’s call. 😥

**General:**

A few Radicle folks (Abbey, Nas & Andrew for example) will be at ETH Denver!! Reach out in the Community channel on Discord if you will also be there!

🔗 **Radicle Link Team:**

No presentation from the Link team this week, but all updates can be found [here](https://radicle.community/t/link-road-plan-22/2658)!

🌈 **Upstream:**

Thomas announced updates for Patches with Upstream, replication, a new CLI that improves the patch patch experience and fixing other bugs. You can find the full list of updates here! A reminder that they are still looking for a Product Owner - full info & application instructions are  outlined [here](https://radicle.community/t/upstream-looking-for-product-owner/2638).

🪄 **Alt-Clients:**

Alexis demonstrated the new CLI updates, Radicle client services and Radicle Cloud. They are working on full integration with the web for browsing as well as pier browsing.

💧 **Drips:**

Drips is LIVE!!! If you haven’t checked it out yet -  [click here](https://drips.radicle.network/). The team [announced Drips](https://twitter.com/dripsnetwork/status/1483803076062593029) last week. For a full list of updates from the Drips team check out [this link](https://radicle.community/t/drips-team-january-26th-2022-community-update/2662). To stay up to date on all things Drips - follow [Drips on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dripsnetwork).

🤝**Community & Governance:**

Abbey discussed some of the restructuring that will happen to the Community & Governance team for 2022. Some of the notable items include:

- Cleaning up and improve accessibility of public resources.
- Bringing on more (wo)man power and introducing new Discord roles to facilitate a better community experience.
- Focus on transition for the DAO - plan for 2022 and expanding decentralization coming soon!
- Community delegates program
- Support emergence of operations of community-led working groups e.g. Radicle Grants Program, treasury management in the future
- Support community associate operations and growth through marketing and partnerships

Shelby discussed the new delegation process and platform that the Governance WG has been working on. This process allows community members to announce themselves as delegates and represent their community in the Radicle governance process. The platform will be a one-stop-shop with all active delegate profiles, making it easy for other community members to find folks to delegate to.

The docs are ready to go but need the Code of Conduct to be cleared before sharing. This will hopefully be live early next week (KW5)!!

🔗 **Radicle Link Team:**

Key updates from the Link team include implementing solution to branch tracking ([see RFC](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-link/blob/master/docs/rfc/0699-tracking-storage.adoc#batch-tracking)), the use of the tracking figuration was integrated into replication, a new standalone MVPeer, and update on [RFC 701](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-link/blob/master/docs/rfc/0701-mutual-synchronisation.adoc), and improvements to CI builds. Will focus on application architecture work over next weeks. Full notes on all Link updates can be found [here](https://radicle.community/t/link-february-2022-community-update/2739).

🌈 **Upstream:**

Their search for a new Product Owner is over! Julien introduced Kai (Discord: Kaidao#3125) who will be helping the Upstream team create a long-term product roadmap and workstreams. He also discussed improvements to their patches feature and efforts towards making sure Upstream is compatible with what the alt-clients team is shipping.

🛶 **Workstream:**

Following some research Nassar had done which showed interest of DAOs looking for a way to pay for grants and contributions in a native web3 way, the Workstream team has started working on a MVP to make it possible. Worksteam will be built on top of the Drips protocol initially. You can follow their journey in the #work-streams Discord channel.

🪄 **Alt-Clients:**

Alexis showed new UI updates including to the peer selector and commit view. They also updated  ENS registration views to work with any ENS name (and not with just Radicle names) and introduced three new seeds nodes that they will be launching with. The CLI is ready to be used for collaboration. Alexis also demonstrated some new commands they added and answered questions regarding the definition of “delegates” and Seed IDs.

💧 **Drips:**

Drips has survived its first month live! The last month has been focused on gathering feedback from early users and launching a partnership with Polygon. Andrew also met with a few folks excited to integrate drips at ETH Denver. There is currently an SDK being built to allow others to build off of Drips. There was a broader discussion about how Radicle could use Drips to stream funds from the DAO to fund projects and contributions - potential dog-fooding via Radicle Grants.  If you haven’t yet follow [Drips on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dripsnetwork) to stay up to date with new developments!

💸 **Grants:**

Bordumb continued the dog-fooding discussion from the Drips presentation and added that it might be good to wait until we add options besides ERC20 tokens to make it more compatible with other networks. He reminded the teams that a lot of work can be potentially handed off to the Grants Program in the form of RFPs. He wants to continue collecting ideas for future RFPs over the coming weeks.

🤝 **Community & Governance:**

Abbey & Nas were unable to make the call but Abbey provided a written update on the Community side that can be found here (link coming soon).

Shelby briefly discussed the Snapshot results of the two proposals in the Formal Review stage. Both the [removing name registration fee](https://radicle.community/t/formal-review-v2-remove-name-registration-fee/2720/6) and [Radicle Ecosystem Growth Fund](https://radicle.community/t/formal-review-radicle-ecosystem-growth-fund-egf/2721/4) proposals passed to move on to the next and final stage of the governance process. These should be ready and up for an on-chain vote next week. The Governance WG will be working on doing some stakeholder mapping and outreach to increase participation in governance by encouraging either direct participation or through delegation. With the launch of the [Active Delegate Platform](https://www.notion.so/02bd9d2ca1b64e04bc92dc93ff823afb) last month it is now easier than ever to find community delegates for any $RAD holder to delegate to if they are unable/do not want to participate in voting on proposals directly.

👾 **Misc:**

We are planning a casual dinner for the Radicle community in Berlin on March 17th. We will send around details on how to say if you would like to participate (most likely on Discord) soon so we can coordinate numbers. There are also quite a few folks planning on attending ETH Amsterdam in April.
