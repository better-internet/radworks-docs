title: Transition to the DAO
---

## Decentralization of the Radicle Project

From its inception, Radicle was envisioned as a new kind of open-source project — one built, governed, and financed on
the internet. Over the past few years, the team has been deploying the technical, economic, and social foundations
necessary to achieve [this
vision](https://radicle.community/t/the-path-to-increasing-decentralization-within-radicle/2417). 

This started with the creation of the Radicle Foundation and deployment of the RAD governance token in early 2021. This
was the first step towards the creation of the DAO and handing over POWER to contributors to the project. The Foundation
funded and managed most core Radicle development and their core teams. The RAD token ensured a health treasury to start
funding development and initiatives from. An initial governance process was announced in February 2021 and has seen
various proposals pass through its process.

## Radicle Foundation -> Radicle DAO

Throughout the past year, [furthering
decentralization](https://radicle.community/t/the-next-phase-of-the-radicledao/2776) of the project has been a priority.
A large part of this work entails transitioning core team funding and coordination responsibilities of the Foundation
over to the DAO.  Four “workstreams” were formed to explore important aspects of the transition in detail. These included
*Org Design, DAO Tooling, Distribution of Ownership* and *Distribution of Influence.* All posts and updates for each
workstream can be found under the [Transition to the
DAO](https://radicle.community/c/governance/dao-transition/34) section on radicle.community. As outlined in the [Next
Phase of RadicleDAO](https://radicle.community/t/the-next-phase-of-the-radicledao/2776/16), we’ll be putting scaffolding
in place to transition Core Teams to the DAO over the next year.

The Orgs (or sub-DAOs) of the Radicle DAO ecosystem will include the Radicle Grants Org, Radicle Org, Drips Org, Governance Org and the Radicle Foundation
Org. Radicle Grants will be responsible for funding technical proposals that support open source initiatives that help grow the Radicle product, community,
and the greater Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and Web3 community at large. The Radicle Org will continue to develop a decentralized code
collaboration network built on open protocols. The Drips Org will continue developing a circular and sustainable social funding network built on Ethereum.
The Governance Org will steward governance of the RadicleDAO and support community-led initiatives related to treasury management, project
decentralization, and governance design. The Radicle Foundation will remain at a very limited capacity as an entity that safeguards Radicle trademarks and
can be funded by the DAO (like any other contributor) to accomplish any offline activities and anything the DAO can’t do.

## Path Forward

The [Core Development Org Working
Group](https://radicle.community/t/open-call-core-development-org-design-working-group/3042) has been collaborating with core teams to scope the shifting
types of roles and responsibilities that come with the DAO transition. These changes sparks discussions around how decisions will be made within and
between the Orgs. The consideration of changing governance needs also extends to the coordination across the entire DAO, requiring us to consider
governance mechanisms that go beyond token governance, such as non-tokenized options, to effectively and efficiently be able to function as a DAO. The goal
is to have these new Orgs and necessary governance upgrades in place by the end of Q1 2023.

The definition of this emerging process has only been possible through the participation and contributions of Radicle’s
contributors. Navigating such a big change has been no small task and if we are going to truly create a sustainable and
prosperous future for the project it needed to receive input from as many perspectives as possible.
