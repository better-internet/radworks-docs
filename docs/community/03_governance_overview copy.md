Welcome to RadicleDAO's version-controlled governance documentation! These docs consist of carefully curated information
and resources that lay out the Radicle’s token voting governance process and how to participate in it.

The RadicleDAO’s Treasury is controlled by a tokenized governance mechanism (Compound-Governor) via the project’s native governance token ($RAD). With token governance, holders of $RAD holders can participate in the decision-making around the treasury by voting and creating on-chain governance proposals composed of executable actions. Currently, these actions include:
Treasury distributions of RAD, ETH, and USDC
Upgrades to the on-chain governance system
Changes to parameters of Treasury-governed contracts (e.g. Drips)

There are a total of 100M $RAD tokens. Proposals can be proposed on-chain by anyone who has an amount of $RAD greater than or equal to 1% of the total token supply delegated to their address. Once proposed, $RAD-holding participants can vote for/against the proposal on-chain. Voting must meet a participation threshold of 4% of total supply to pass. The proposal only passes if the participation threshold is met and votes are a majority “in-favor”. Once passed, the actions outlined in the proposal are executed. To learn more about token governance and how the RadicleDAO’s on-chain governance system works, see here.

### Obtaining $RAD

$RAD is the native governance token for Radicle, making it the first open-source, community-led, and self-sustaining
network for software collaboration. Read more about $RAD in our [introductory blog
post](https://radicle.mirror.xyz/CgcHpSXUlPvwMVaUVVaJ7r8bIJI2BOKOytaI9-nO9oY).

You can obtain $RAD from a number of sources, including decentralized exchanges (e.g.
[Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7c8dbf6e88f52cb56dd30190558cb982f62fc660)) and various centralized
exchanges (e.g. Coinbase).

:::note

For legal reasons, Radicle team cannot apply for or encourage listings. If you're interested in a listing on a specific
exchange, you can ask the exchange yourself. Trading on other exchanges also increases the overall order volume and
makes the token listing more likely in new places.
