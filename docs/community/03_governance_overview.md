Welcome to RadicleDAO's version-controlled governance documentation! These docs consist of carefully curated information
and resources that lay out the Radicle’s token voting governance process and how to participate in it.

Radwork’s treasury is controlled by an on-chain governance mechanism ([Compound-Governor](https://wiki.tally.xyz/docs/compound-governor)) via the project’s native governance token ($RAD). Holders of this token can participate in the decision-making around the treasury by voting and creating on-chain governance proposals composed of executable actions. Currently, these actions include:
* Treasury distributions of RAD, ETH, and USDC
* Upgrades to the on-chain governance system
* Changes to parameters of Treasury-governed contracts (e.g. Drips)

### Obtaining $RAD

$RAD is the native governance token for Radicle, making it the first open-source, community-led, and self-sustaining
network for software collaboration. Read more about $RAD in our [introductory blog
post](https://radicle.mirror.xyz/CgcHpSXUlPvwMVaUVVaJ7r8bIJI2BOKOytaI9-nO9oY).

You can obtain $RAD from a number of sources, including decentralized exchanges (e.g.
[Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7c8dbf6e88f52cb56dd30190558cb982f62fc660)) and various centralized
exchanges (e.g. Coinbase).

:::note

For legal reasons, Radicle team cannot apply for or encourage listings. If you're interested in a listing on a specific
exchange, you can ask the exchange yourself. Trading on other exchanges also increases the overall order volume and
makes the token listing more likely in new places.
