Welcome to Radworks' version-controlled governance documentation! These docs consist of carefully curated information
and resources that lay out the Radicle’s token voting governance process and how to participate in it.

Radworks’ treasury is controlled by an on-chain governance mechanism ([Compound-Governor](https://wiki.tally.xyz/docs/compound-governor)) via the project’s native governance token ($RAD). Holders of this token can participate in the decision-making around the treasury by voting and creating on-chain governance proposals composed of executable actions. Currently, these actions include:
* Treasury distributions of RAD, ETH, and USDC
* Upgrades to the on-chain governance system
* Changes to parameters of Treasury-governed contracts (e.g. Drips)
