To get involved with the Radicle project, start by joining our community channels:

## [Discord](https://discord.gg/j2HZCBDUvF)

Most conversations in the community are happening here. The core team is very active and typically responds to questions
in real time.

## [Discourse](https://radicle.community/)

The hub for all longer-form discussions about the project. The team uses it regularly to share project-wide
announcements, releases, feature updates, and more.

## [Twitter](https://twitter.com/radicle)

We use Twitter to share announcements and project-wide updates, as well as amplify Radicle-aligned messaging from
partnerships and the greater ecosystem. We don't offer support here.

## [GitHub](https://github.com/radicle-dev)

All Radicle development is open-source and public by default. The `radicle-dev` GitHub account is consistently active
and is the best place to see what the team is working on until Radicle itself has features like issues, patches, and
CI/CD.

## [Matrix](https://matrix.radicle.community/)

Some of the core team uses Matrix, and the Discord channels are mirrored here. Information on Matrix is almost the same
as Discord.

## [Telegram](https://t.me/radicleworld)

Larger announcements are posted in our official Telegram channel. There are also other channels sprouting up which are
quite active.
