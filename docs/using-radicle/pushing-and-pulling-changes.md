## Committing and pushing code

To push code to Radicle, you first need to make sure your shell is configured correctly by following the instructions in the [Getting Started](getting-started/doc1-1.md) section. 

After the Radicle remote helper is configured, pushing to Radicle is as simple as pushing to pushing to any other platform. After changes are added and commited, they can be pushed to the Radicle remote via `git push rad`. For help using Git, please refer to [relevant documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git).

It's important to note that once changes are pushed to the Radicle remote, they are published to the Radicle network and are available to anybody who is connected to you in the network. 

Radicle projects also support [branches](understanding-radicle/glossary.md/#branch). A new branch can be made by following common Git commands.

`git checkout -b <branch name>`

It can be pushed to Radicle with:

`git push rad <branch name>`

## Finding & cloning projects

### Following projects

To contribute to another user's project to your machine, you must first find it on the Radicle network. To find a project, you need it's [**projectID**](understanding-radicle/glossary.md/#project-id). This can be found under in the project page under the [project name](understanding-radicle/glossary.md/#project-name), or in a seed node UI.

Once found, copy the projectID into the Upstream search bar. If the project exists in your network of connected peers, it will appear. Following the project will replicate it to you local machine.

### Cloning projects

To clone a working copy of a followed project to your computer, you can use the [**Checkout**](understanding-radicle/glossary.md/#checkout) option within the Upstream client. This will clone the project to a specified location on your local machine and initialize a Git repository.

Commiting and publishing changes to this working copy will create a new [remote](understanding-radicle/glossary.md/#remote) for that project that is uniquely linked to your peerID. You can view this remote in the peer switcher.

Once a remote is created for a project, it will also add the project to your **My Projects** tab. 

## Getting changes from a project 

### Adding remotes
To view and pull changes from another user's version of your project, you must first **add their remote**. To do this, you must add their **peerID** to your list of remotes.

Adding a user's remote is basically adding their version of your project to your machine. Once added, you'll be able to fetch changes from their version and apply them to your working copy. Read more about [how remotes work on Radicle](understanding-radicle/faq.md).

You can view all remotes of a project with the command:

`git remote show` 

Or, list all the branches of a remote with the command:

`git branch -a`

### Fetching changes
After a remote has been added, any changes can be fetched with:

` git fetch <remote> ` 

Whereas the `<remote>` is the identifier found below the designated user in the Manage Remotes modal. (need to check on this)
