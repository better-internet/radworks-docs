Radicle is a collective of independently-developed protocols and projects that use those protocols — and in the future,
will hopefully involve projects developed outside the Radicle team entirely — which means there will never be *one* way
to perform a given action using a Radicle protocol or the Radicle network.

Instead, this documentation offers an opinionated view, using Radicle-developed projects, on how to take common actions
around hosting code on the Radicle network and collaborating with others.

For more help on using Radicle, be sure to join our [community channels][get-involved/community.md].
