## How do I collaborate on Radicle?

Radicle Link is designed for bazaar-style development. This means that there is
no single canonical view (e.g. master) of any project, but multiple upstreams
maintained by maintainers and contributors that exchange patches with each
other.

Within the same project, two people will have subjective (and often diverging
views), but *your* view of the project becomes the sum of all other views of the
project. Conceptually, the project becomes decentralized
among the many views of it's maintainers and contributors, instead of being
confined to the control of a small group of people with read/write access.

In practice, this means that to fetch and receive changes from contributors, you
have to **add other people as remotes to your project**. Adding someone as a
remote automatically tracks them, giving you a way to continuously subscribe to
the updates they make to your project (i.e. new commits).

The introduction of social coding features like bug reporting, patches, and code
review will improve the process of finding and fetching changes between people
on the Radicle network by making it easier to know those changes exist in the
first place.

To help make Radicle's collaboration model easier to understand, here are some
guides for answering some common questions we get on how to use Radicle:

* [How do I publish a project?][1]
* [How do I push changes to my project?][2]
* [How do I share my project?][3]
* [How do I see contributions or changes to my project?][4]
* [How do I fetch and merge contributions to my project?][5]
* [How do I find other projects?][6]
* [How do I contribute to a project?][7]
