## Finding projects

Projects can be shared with their **Radicle ID**. The Radicle ID can be copied
from the project page.

![Radicle ID][ri]

A Radicle ID is a URN with the following format:

`rad:git:hwd1yrerye4msk57338r71kk9nb1sjdpkeaiqx7tq1138n48enojgsw3ksw`

Copy and pasting a project's Radicle ID into your search bar and following it
will send out a request to your network. 

![Search and Follow][sf]

Once requested, you'll be able to view and replicate the project once a
connected peer makes it available to you. 

![Still Looking][sl]

When a project has been successfully replicated, it will appear in your
**Following** tab. Replicating a project also makes it available
to all of your connected peers. To learn more about following & replication, see 
[How it Works][un].
