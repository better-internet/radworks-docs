## Finding projects

Projects can be found with their **Radicle ID**. The Radicle ID can be copied
from the project page.

![Radicle ID][ri]

A Radicle ID is a URN with the following format:

`rad:git:hnrkmzko1nps1pjogxadcmqipfxpeqn6xbeto`

Copy and pasting a project's Radicle ID into your search bar and following it
will send out a request to your network.

![Search and Follow][sf]

You'll be able to view and replicate the project once a connected peer makes it
available to you.

![Still Looking][sl]

When a project has been successfully replicated, it will appear in your
**Following** tab. Replicating a project also makes it available to all of your
connected peers. To learn more about following & replication, see [How it
Works][un].
