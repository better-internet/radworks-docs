## Finding projects

Projects can be shared with their Radicle ID. The Radicle ID can be copied from
the project page.

[insert picture of radicle id on project page]

A Radicle ID is a URN with the following format:

`rad:git:hwd1yrerye4msk57338r71kk9nb1sjdpkeaiqx7tq1138n48enojgsw3ksw`

Copy and pasting a project's Radicle ID into your search bar and following it
will send out a request to your network. 

[include screenshot on following]

Once requested, you'll be able to view replicate the project once a connected
peer makes it available to you. Following a project will also replicate it to
your local machine, making it available to all of your connected peers. To learn
more about following & replication, [See How it Works][un].

## Sharing projects

In order for another person to find and track your project on the Radicle
network, you need to share your project's Radicle ID. You can copy it from your
project page.
