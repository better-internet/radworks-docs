## Finding projects

Projects can be shared with their Radicle ID. The Radicle ID can be copied from
the project page.

A Radicle ID is a URN with the following format:

rad:git// etc....

Copy and pasting a project's Radicle ID into your search bar will find it on the
network for you. Following a project will replicate it to your local machine,
making it available to all of your connected peers. To learn more about
following & replication, [click here][un].

## Sharing projects

In order for another person to find and track your project on the Radicle
network, you need to share your project's Radicle ID. You can copy it from your
project page.
