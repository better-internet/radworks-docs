title: Running a seed node
---

To improve data availability, participants in the network can choose to act as
[seeds][se]. Seeds are always-on nodes that automatically track discovered
projects, thereby increasing the availability of these projects on the network.
Conceptually, they are similar to pubs in [Secure Scuttlebutt][ss].

To build and run a seed node, you'll have to install some prerequisites on your
machine first:

  - [Rust toolchain][ru]
  - [yarn][ya]

Next, clone and set up the `radicle-bins` repository:

    git clone https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-bins.git
    cd radicle-bins

Install UI depependencies and build the UI:

    (cd seed/ui && yarn && yarn build)

Next, let's set up a directory where the seed can store its data. This is
important in case you are running a Radicle Upstream client on the same machine.
The default path for both Radicle Upstream and the seed node would otherwise be
the same and could result in unexpected behaviour.

    mkdir -p ~/.radicle-seed

Then, you'll have to generate a private key:

    cargo run -p radicle-keyutil -- --filename ~/.radicle-seed/secret.key

In order for people to connect to the seed node from the internet, you'll have
to allow incomming connections for the following ports:

  - `UDP:12345`  - for peer data exchange
  - `TCP:80`     - for the seed node UI

For this example, let's assume that we have the public IP address `1.2.3.4` at
our disposal and that our router is set up to forward the ports UDP:12345 and
TCP:80 to the machine where the seed node will be running.

While not strictly necessary, it's nice to have a domain name set up for the
public IP address as well. For this example, we'll use this record:
`seed.my.org. A 1.2.3.4`.

Now you're ready to start the seed node. Let's configure it to listen on ports
12345 and 80 on all interfaces, the private key is supplied via `STDIN`:

    cargo run -p radicle-seed-node --release -- \
      --root ~/.radicle-seed \
      --peer-listen 0.0.0.0:12345 \
      --http-listen 0.0.0.0:80 \
      --name "seedling" \
      --public-addr "seed.my.org:12345" \
      --assets-path seed/ui/public \
      < ~/.radicle-seed/secret.key

**Note:** we configured the seed to use `~/.radicle-seed` as its data directory
with the `--root` option. The `--public-addr` option is needed so the UI can
show the seed address, more on that below.

  <summary>
    This is what you'll see in the terminal when starting the seed node:
  </summary>

    $ cargo run -p radicle-seed-node --release -- \
      --root ~/.radicle-seed \
      --peer-listen 0.0.0.0:12345 \
      --http-listen 0.0.0.0:80 \
      --name "seedling" \
      --public-addr "seed.my.org:12345" \
      --assets-path seed/ui/public \
      < ~/.radicle-seed/secret.key

Now point your browser http://seed.my.org. This is the seed node dashboard.

![Seed node UI][sn]

For Upstream clients to connect to your new seed, you'll need to share the seed
address. This address can be found in the UI under the name of the seed. In our
example the address is:

    hyy5s7ysg96fqa91gbe7h38yddh4mkokft7y4htt8szt9e17sxoe3h@seed.my.org:12345

Have a look at the [Adding a custom seed node][ad] section for more information
on how to set up the new seed in Upstream.
