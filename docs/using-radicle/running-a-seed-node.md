title: Running a seed node
---

To improve data availability, participants in the network can choose to act as
seeds. This is similar in concept to a pub in Secure Scuttlebutt: seeds are
always-on nodes that automatically track discovered projects, thereby
increasing the availability of these projects on the network.

To set up your own seed node follow the [instructions][seed] in the
`radicle-bins` repository.
