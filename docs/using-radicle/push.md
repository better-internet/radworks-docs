title: Push your changes
---

How you make changes to your local working copy of a Radicle project is entirely up to you. Once you're finished, add
and commit your changes with `git add` and `git commit` just as you would when collaborating on any other Git-based
forge like GitHub or GitLab. 

Use `rad push` to synchronize your changes with a secondary source tree within the project.

```
$ rad push
Pushing üå± to remote `rad`
$ git push rad
