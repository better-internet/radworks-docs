title: Creating patches

To contribute to another user's project, you must first find it on the network.
To find a project, you need its [**Radicle ID**][ri]. This can be found in the
project page under the project name, or in a seed node dashboard such as
[sprout.radicle.xyz](http://sprout.radicle.xyz).

![Identity][id]

Once you have the Radicle ID, copy it into the Upstream search bar. From there,
you can follow the project to track it. This will replicate it to your local
machine once it's found in your network of connected peers. You won't see any
information on the project until it is verified by the protocol.

### Forking projects

To create your own view of a project, you can use the **Fork** option within the
Upstream client. This will clone the project to a specified location on your
local machine and publish your version to the Radicle network as a new project.

![Fork Project][fo]

Forking a project will move it from the **Following** tab to the **Projects**
tab. This is because once you fork a project, you create your own view of it
that is unique to your Device ID. You can [push changes][pc] to this view via
the `rad` remote and publish them to the network. You are able to clone your
project with the **Checkout** option on your project page.

### Creating a patch

Now that you have your own view of the project and you have it checked out, you
can start creating a patch. In your view of the project you'll see a `Patches`
tab next to `Files` and `Commits`. There you see a `New patch` button which will
guide you through the steps.

![New Patch][np]

First, make your changes and commit them locally. Next, package them as a patch
by creating an annotated git tag:

`git tag--annotate radicle-patch/<name>`

Be sure to replace `<name>` with the name of your patch.

Next git will allow you to add a title and description to the tag, those will be
the ones that show up in the UI, so be sure to add those to make it easy for the
maintainer to understand the changes you're proposing.

<!-- TODO: Replace with screenshot showing the tag message thing -->

![Tag Message][tm]

All that's left to do is to publish the new patch by simply pushing the git tag
to the network: `git push --tags rad`. Your patch is now public ðŸŽ‰.

Make sure the maintainer has added your Device ID as a remote on their project
so that they see your patch. To learn how to do that, take a look at [tracking
and viewing contributions][tv].

If you are a maintainer, share your contact information with potential
contributors so they can give you their Device IDs and easily submit patches.
Your `README.md` might be a good place for this.
