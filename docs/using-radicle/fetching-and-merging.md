title: Viewing and merging patches
---

To be able to collaborate on a Radicle project, you need to know how to view and
merge patches from other people. To view and merge patches from a contributor,
you first need to add them as a remote to your project. If you haven't done so,
follow the instructions in [Tracking & viewing contributions][tv] section.

If you can see a peer's patches after adding them as a remote, they have been
successfully replicated to your machine. If you have added a peer as a remote
and can't see their changes, head over to our [FAQ][fq] section.
