## checkout
To create a working copy of a [project][pr]. This working copy is where a
[user][us] can make and publish changes to the project via 'git push rad'. For
more on how working copies work in Radicle, see [Working Copies][hiw-wc].

## connect
To create a network connection to another Radicle [peer][pe]. Connected peers
spread information between each other via [gossip][gp].

## contributor
A [peer][pe] who has pushed code to a [project][pr].

## Device ID
The encoding of a [peer][pr]'s public key tied to their device. In the Beta,
there will only be one Device ID per user (See [Data Model][hiw-dm])

## display name
A changeable and non-unique human-readable name chosen by an Upstream
[user][us]. Like a "nickname" for someone's [Radicle ID][ri]. This will be
possible to change in the future. 

## follow
Following a [project][pr] replicates its data to your machine. This allows the
follower to subscribe to updates from the project's [maintainer(s)][ma] or other
remotes. It is also a way to signal interest in the project or peer by further
replicating the data across their network, making it available to other people
on the network. See [Tracking][tr].

## git
A free and open source distributed version control system.

## gossip
A means of peer-to-peer communication that relies on the interactions of peers
to disseminate information. Participants in the Radicle network share and spread
data by keeping redundant copies of projects locally and sharing updates with
peers. This allows data to be disseminated according to use and value: the more
peers who are interested in certain data the more available it is made to the
network. See [Gossip][hiw-rm].

## maintainer
A [user][us] who manages and pushes updates to the canonical view of a project.
A maintainer is explicitly associated with the [project][pr] at the time of
creation or later, via the [project][pr] metadata (see [Data Model][hiw-dm]),
but there may be multiple maintainers of a project, all maintaining their own
trees. At creation, the creator of the [project][pr] is the sole maintainer.

## main
How Radicle Upstream refers to the default development branch of a project.

## node
A [peer][pr] running an instance of the Radicle Link protocol. There can only be
one node running per device.

## passphrase
A sequence of characters used to encrypt a peer's private key (See
[Identities][hiw-id]) to enable access to the Radicle network. It's also needed
to fetch and push changesets to the Radicle network. 

## peer
A device running the Radicle Link protocol.

## project
A [project][pr] consists of source code, issues, and proposed changesets. It
carries a unique, shareable [Radicle ID][ri]. A [project][pr] also includes the
identities of all its [maintainers][ma]. The entirety of the [project][pr] data
and metadata, including social artifacts such as comments, are stored within the
[project][pr]'s repository on the user's machine. [Project][pr]s are the
principle unit of replication.

## project name
A human-readable name that is chosen for a [project][pe]. It is not guaranteed
to be unique.

## publish
To make data public to the network. Once something is published, it may be
fetched and replicated by connected peers.

## Radicle ID
A unique shareable identifier for projects in the Radicle Network. Radicle IDs
are usually shared as URNs.

## Radicle Link
A peer-to-peer replication protocol built on Git. See [How it Works][hiw].

## Radicle network
The network of peers that replicate and gossip data with Radicle Link.

## Radicle Upstream
An open-source desktop application (graphic [user][us] interface, GUI) built to
interact with and enable access to the Radicle Network and, initially, the
primary end-[user][us] experience. However, in the future, it will be one of
many potential clients that [user][us]s can use to access the Radicle Network.

## remote
Another peer's view of a project. Remotes can be pulled/fetched from.
Maintainers of a project may choose to track other peer's views of their project
by adding them as a remote. In the context of a project, maintainers of a
repository may choose to track the views of other owners by adding them as a
remote to the project. If the remote repository is found to track other remotes,
the tracking repository shall also transitively track those, up to a
configurable N degrees out.

## seed
An always-on node that automatically tracks discovered projects and serves data
to their connected peers, thereby increasing the availability of these projects
on the network. More on the [role and impacts of seeds][rl].

## upstream
The [repository][re] in which code contributions for a [project][pr] are
intended to be merged once they pass the review process (i.e. canonical upstream
or mainline). The upstream is often the [repository][re] of the [project][pr]'s
original maintainer or creator. For everyone but the creator of this
[repository][re], upstream will be a remote [repository][re].

## user
Any individual who has created a Radicle ID on the Radicle network via the
Upstream client.
