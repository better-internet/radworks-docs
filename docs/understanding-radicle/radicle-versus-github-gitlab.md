title: Radicle versus GitHub and GitLab
---

You probably already use GitHub or GitLab for code hosting and collaboration, and we recognize that to convince you to
migrate to Radicle, you want to know how the products stack up. Let’s talk about how they differentiate in key areas.

This isn't designed to be a comprehensive feature-by-feature comparison, but rather to provide transparency into the
core philosophies behind Radicle's continued development of sovereign code infrastructure.

## Fundamentals

### Open source

**Radicle** uses an [open-source stack](https://github.com/radicle-dev) from  top to bottom—there are no “closed” components. Every component of the Radicle stack is auditable, modifiable, and extendable.

**GitHub** uses proprietary code.

**GitLab** uses [open-source code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org) across its stack.

### Authorship

**Radicle** automatically verifies, through cryptographic keys, all user artifacts, like comments, issues, and code reviews, ensuring you know who you’re collaborating with even if you don’t know their “true” identity.

### Sovereign

**Radicle** user and project identities, plus all metadata, is completely owned by you.

### Distributed

**Radicle** 

Radicle is ****not**** global by default. Instead, the social graph of peers and projects you track determines what content you see, interact with, and replicate.

### Local-first

**Radicle** 

5. Radicle is designed for bazaar-style development. This means that within projects, there isn't a single master branch that contributors merge into. Instead, peers maintain their own views of projects that can be fetched and merged by other peers via patches.

### Censorship-resistant

**Radicle** 

**Radicle is a self-sustained and community-owned network** — not a corporation. It's governance is organized by a token called RAD that lives on Ethereum.
