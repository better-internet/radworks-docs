title: How does Radicle governance work? ‚öñÔ∏è
---

:::note

The information below outlines Radicle‚Äôs current governance process. As Radicle transitions further to the DAO, there may be a few changes in tools, process and organization. We will be sure to keep the community updated and involved each step of the way!

:::

Radicle operates via tokenized governance, where the Radicle token (RAD) is the designated governance token. RAD holders can influence decisions concerning the project by proposing changes and voting on new proposals. Each [Radicle token](https://radicle.xyz/blog/introducing-rad.html) is equal to one vote. You can find more details on proposing and voting below. 

Below is a roadmap of the proposal process. Proposals should include executable code and can be proposed by anyone who has 1% RAD delegated to their address. Once a proposal is implemented, the code that is part of the proposal is executed. These posts can be found at [radicle.community](http://radicle.community) under the *Governance* section.
