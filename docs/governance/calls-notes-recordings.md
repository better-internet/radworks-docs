title: Radicle Governance Calls
---

The governance team hosts monthly governance calls on [Discord](https://discord.gg/j2HZCBDUvF) to provide an opportunity
to discuss current governance proposals, share updates from the governance team, and highlight important discussion
around the transition to the DAO. This is also a great opportunity to ask questions and communicate ideas or concerns
around governance of the project.

These calls tend to take place on the second Wednesday of every month. To figure out when the next call is happening,
check our "Events" section on Discord. We also post reminders for these calls in
the [#governance-updates](https://discord.com/channels/841318878125490186/955793826264514560) channel.
