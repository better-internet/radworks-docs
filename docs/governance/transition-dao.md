![Transition to the DAO](/img/transition-dao.png)

The Foundation currently funds and manages most core Radicle development, but the ultimate goal has always been to ultimately fund all project development via the Treasury of the RadicleDAO. As outlined in the [Next Phase of RadicleDAO](https://radicle.community/t/the-next-phase-of-the-radicledao/2776), we’d like to have the scaffolding in place to transition Core Teams to the DAO by November 2022 and initial teams transitioned by **February 2023.** 

To formulate and execute these goals, we have created four *workstreams* focusing on different aspects of the transition. All posts and updates for each workstream can be found under the [Transition to the DAO](https://radicle.community/c/governance/dao-transition/34) section on radicle.community. You can also follow updates from the workstreams on Discord in the coresponding channels under *Governance.* If you would like to get involved with any of the workstreams, please respond to the corresponding post.
