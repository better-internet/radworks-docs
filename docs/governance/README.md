Welcome to RadicleDAO's version-controlled governance documentation! These docs consist of carefully curated information
and resources that lay out the Radicle’s token voting governance process and how to participate in it.

Radicle is the most resilient open source code collaboration infrastructure to
date. [Decentralization](https://radicle.community/t/the-path-to-increasing-decentralization-within-radicle/2417) is not
only at the core of our tech foundation, but it is what drives project development via community governance and
coordination. If you want to build the future of decentralized code collaboration with us, read on!

There are currently several areas of focus within the governance team. If you are interested in joining any of the
initiatives below, send us a note on Discord! 

**Steward Governance**

Facilitate the coordination around governance proposals, maintain relevant governance resources and documentation,
communicate governance updates to the broader community, and actively develop tooling & process improvements.

**Transition to the DAO**

Conceptualize changing governance needs and possible improvements that will be needed to effectively and efficiently
function as a DAO. This includes strategizing how we can better distribute influence and ownership of the project within
the project. 

**Treasury Management**

Develop a coordinated, value-aligned treasury management mission and initiate the creation of a Treasury Management
Working Group to help create and maintain a mission-focused treasury strategy.
