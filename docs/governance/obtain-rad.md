are endorsed by the Radicle Foundation, Treasury, or DAO.

## When will Rad be listed on my preferred exchange?

For legal reasons, Radicle team cannot apply for or encourage listings. If you're interested in a listing on a specific
exchange, you can ask the exchange yourself. Trading on other exchanges also increases the overall order volume and
makes the token listing more likely in new places.
