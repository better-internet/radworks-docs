title: Obtaining $RAD
---

$RAD is the native governance token for Radicle, making it the first open-source, community-led, and self-sustaining
network for software collaboration. Read more about $RAD in ourÂ [introductory blog
post](https://radicle.mirror.xyz/CgcHpSXUlPvwMVaUVVaJ7r8bIJI2BOKOytaI9-nO9oY).

You can obtain $RAD from a number of sources, including decentralized exchanges (e.g.
[Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7c8dbf6e88f52cb56dd30190558cb982f62fc660)) and various centralized
exchanges (e.g. Coinbase).

:::note

For legal reasons, Radicle team cannot apply for or encourage listings. If you're interested in a listing on a specific
exchange, you can ask the exchange yourself. Trading on other exchanges also increases the overall order volume and
makes the token listing more likely in new places.
