title: What is the Radicle Treasury? ðŸ’°
---

Governance is also employed to manage the [Radicle
Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8da8f82d2bbdd896822de723f55d6edf416130ba#tokentxns), a community owned and
governed pool of capital for developing and growing the Radicle network and community. Using the [financial firepower
provided by the treasury](https://deepdao.io/#/deepdao/dao/5bbc03cc-2e74-40f9-8ab8-7e9cfcb642ff/topLevel), Radicleâ€™s
community of token holders can propose, vote on, and implement initiatives that make Radicle a core piece of internet
infrastructure. The Radicle Treasury will fund the maintenance, development, and growth of the Radicle network and its
participants in perpetuity.
