## Proposing üíç

Anybody with 1M RAD (1% of total RAD supply) delegated to their address can propose a Governance Proposal.

1. Submit a **Temperature Check** for a proposal to the governance forum. Please follow the formal below:
   - **Summary** - A brief description of the proposal and its end goal.
   - **Motivation** - An overview of the motivation behind the proposal, including the context and other helpful details.
   - **Specification** - List any technical specifications to the proposal as well as any foreseeable pros/cons.
2. Use feedback from the Temperature Check to draft a proposal that meets the criteria set in this document and start a
   **Structured Discussion** *(t/r 5 days)*
3. Use feedback from the Temperature Check to draft a proposal that meets the criteria set in this document and start a
   Structured Discussion (t/r 5 days)
   - üö®¬†Voting for Snapshot polls should start on a **Monday, at 5pm CET** and end on the **following Monday, at 5pm CET**
4. If passed, deploy a Governance Proposal via¬†[rad gov](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radgov).¬†*(t/r 3 days)*

See a full description of the [stages of proposal
implementation](https://radicle.community/t/readme-radicle-governance-process/526).

:::note

Community ‚ÄúChampions‚Äù (the individual(s) who created a proposal) are expected to escalate proposals from phase to phase,
with guidance from community moderators. This also means they are responsible for creating forum posts for each stage.
If the original Champion can‚Äôt move a Proposal forward, they are responsible for finding someone to replace them. Any
changes needs to be communicated in the proposal.

## Voting üó≥Ô∏è

Voting requires Radicle (RAD) tokens, which you can [obtain here](governance/obtain-rad.md). One RAD token is equal to
one vote and all voting rounds require a minimum participation threshold of 4M RAD (4% of total RAD supply). Proposals
are passed by obtaining a majority "in-favor" votes.

**Voting takes place both on- and off-chain.**

- Snapshot Votes: Off-chain consensus check via [Snapshot polls](https://snapshot.org/#/gov.radicle.eth) for Temperature Checks that are under Formal Review.
- Governance Proposal Votes: On-chain voting for Governance Proposals take place on [gov.radicle.network](https://gov.radicle.network/#/delegates/radicle).

**You can keep track of all open proposals and vote directly on the [Radicle Governance
Portal](https://boardroom.io/radicle/overview). üå± üèõÔ∏è**

## Delegation ‚ö°

On-chain voting is enabled by delegating voting rights to the address (or addresses) of the token holder's choice:

- The owner‚Äôs own wallet, if they would like to vote on their own.
- Another user's wallet, if they would like the other user to vote on their behalf.
- No wallet, if they don't want to vote.

Delegation takes place on [Sybil](https://gov.radicle.network/#/delegates/radicle). After connecting a wallet holding RAD, you are then able to delegate to either yourself or others. If you are delegating to yourself, after the delegation process is complete you are able to participate in on-chain voting. If you are delegating to others, they will received the amount you delegate as voting power to participate in on-chain voting.

:::note

Any delegation on Sybil for on-chain votes will be mirrored to Snapshot for off-chain votes - i.e. any RAD that is delegated to your wallet on Sybil will be able to be able to be used to vote in off-chain Snapshot polls.

### Delegate types üë•

There are two types of delegates in the Radicle governance process - a regular delegate and an ‚ÄúActive Delegate‚Äù. The main difference between the two is the Active Delegates have shared a more detailed profile of their expertise, governance values and conflicts of interest on the Active Delegate Platform and have committed to share their thoughts on each proposal so token holders are better able to assess  who they would like to delegate to. 

You **DO NOT** have to announce yourself as an¬†active delegate for someone to delegate to your address on Sybil. The Active Delegate Platform is meant to provide an opportunity for motivated community members to make themselves known to the broader Radicle community to let token holders know they are happy to vote on their behalf.

**How to become a Delegate:**

- Verify and announce your delegate address via [sybil.org](http://sybil.org/).

**How to become an Active Delegate:**

- Please read the [Radicle Active Delegate Announcement Process &
    Platform](https://radicle.community/t/radicle-active-delegate-announcement-process-platform/2669) post for further
    details on the platform and goals behind it.
- Follow the steps explained here: [Radicle Delegate Announcement
  Process](https://radicle.community/t/radicle-delegate-announcement-process/2668)

set up [email notifications](https://app.tango.us/app/workflow/Email-Notifications-ac8d8e2eff5746f48ebd17e1f6b2b6ff) directly from the the calendar on our [Boardroom governance portal](https://boardroom.io/radicle/overview). 

The *Radicle Governance Updates* newsletter is a bi-weekly newsletter that provides updates on recent proposals, what
the governance team is focusing on, as well as event and other reminders. You can [subscribe
