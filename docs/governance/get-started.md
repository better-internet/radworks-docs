   - **Specification** - List any technical specifications to the proposal as well as any foreseeable pros/cons.

implementation](https://radicle.community/t/readme-radicle-governance-process/526).

:::note

Community ‚ÄúChampions‚Äù (the individual(s) who created a proposal) are expected to escalate proposals from phase to phase,
with guidance from community moderators. This also means they are responsible for creating forum posts for each stage.
If the original Champion can‚Äôt move a Proposal forward, they are responsible for finding someone to replace them. Any
changes needs to be communicated in the proposal.

## Voting üó≥Ô∏è

Voting requires Radicle (RAD) tokens, which you can [obtain here](governance/obtain-rad.md). One RAD token is equal to
one vote and all voting rounds require a minimum participation threshold of 4M RAD (4% of total RAD supply). Proposals
are passed by obtaining a majority "in-favor" votes.

**Voting takes place both on- and off-chain.**

- Snapshot Votes: Off-chain consensus check via [Snapshot polls](https://snapshot.org/#/gov.radicle.eth) for Temperature Checks that are under Formal Review.
- Governance Proposal Votes: On-chain voting for Governance Proposals take place on [gov.radicle.network](https://gov.radicle.network/#/delegates/radicle).

**You can keep track of all open proposals and vote directly on the [Radicle Governance
Portal](https://boardroom.io/radicle/overview). üå± üèõÔ∏è**

### DELEGATION ‚ö°

On-chain voting is enabled by delegating voting rights to the address (or addresses) of the token holder's choice:

- The owner‚Äôs own wallet, if they would like to vote on their own.
- Another user's wallet, if they would like the other user to vote on their behalf.
- No wallet, if they don't want to vote.
