Some of the notable items include:</p><ul><li>Cleaning up and improve accessibility of public resources.</li><li>Bringing on more (wo)man power and introducing new Discord roles to facilitate a better community experience.</li><li>Focus on transition for the DAO - plan for 2022 and expanding decentralization coming soon!</li><li>Community delegates program</li><li>Support emergence of operations of community-led working groups e.g. Radicle Grants Program, treasury management in the future</li><li>Support community associate operations and growth through marketing and partnerships</li></ul><p>Shelby discussed the new delegation process and platform that the Governance WG has been working on. This process allows community members to announce themselves as delegates and represent their community in the Radicle governance process. The platform will be a one-stop-shop with all active delegate profiles, making it easy for other community members to find folks to delegate to.</p><p>The docs are ready to go but need the Code of Conduct to be cleared before sharing.

Julien introduced Kai (Discord: Kaidao#3125) who will be helping the Upstream team create a long-term product roadmap and workstreams. He also discussed improvements to their patches feature and efforts towards making sure Upstream is compatible with what the alt-clients team is shipping.</p><p>🛶 <strong>Workstream:</strong></p><p>Following some research Nassar had done which showed interest of DAOs looking for a way to pay for grants and contributions in a native web3 way, the Workstream team has started working on a MVP to make it possible. Worksteam will be built on top of the Drips protocol initially. You can follow their journey in the #work-streams Discord channel.</p><p>🪄 <strong>Alt-Clients:</strong></p><p>Alexis showed new UI updates including to the peer selector and commit view. They also updated  ENS registration views to work with any ENS name (and not with just Radicle names) and introduced three new seeds nodes that they will be launching with.

The last month has been focused on gathering feedback from early users and launching a partnership with Polygon. Andrew also met with a few folks excited to integrate drips at ETH Denver. There is currently an SDK being built to allow others to build off of Drips. There was a broader discussion about how Radicle could use Drips to stream funds from the DAO to fund projects and contributions - potential dog-fooding via Radicle Grants.  If you haven’t yet follow <a href="https://twitter.com/dripsnetwork" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drips on Twitter</a> to stay up to date with new developments!</p><p>💸 <strong>Grants:</strong></p><p>Bordumb continued the dog-fooding discussion from the Drips presentation and added that it might be good to wait until we add options besides ERC20 tokens to make it more compatible with other networks.

These should be ready and up for an on-chain vote next week. The Governance WG will be working on doing some stakeholder mapping and outreach to increase participation in governance by encouraging either direct participation or through delegation. With the launch of the <a href="https://www.notion.so/02bd9d2ca1b64e04bc92dc93ff823afb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Delegate Platform</a> last month it is now easier than ever to find community delegates for any $RAD holder to delegate to if they are unable/do not want to participate in voting on proposals directly.</p><p>👾 <strong>Misc:</strong></p><p>We are planning a casual dinner for the Radicle community in Berlin on March 17th. We will send around details on how to say if you would like to participate (most likely on Discord) soon so we can coordinate numbers.
