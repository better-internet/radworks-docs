# Welcome to Radicle Docs ðŸ‘‹

This is the repository for the Radicle documentation site
[docs.radicle.xyz][wi]. radicle-docs accepts contributions via Radicle patches
and GitHub pull requests. This document outlines some contributing guidelines,
contact points, and other resources to make it easier to contribute to
radicle-docs.

[docs.radicle.xyz][wi] was created with [Docusaurus][do]. Full Docusaurus
documentation can be found on their [website][do].

If you've run into a problem or have a suggestion, browse the open [issues][is]
before opening a new one. We use the following [label system][la] to organize
our issues.

* ![][cr] for typos, broken links, and other quick fixes
* ![][tr] for additions to the FAQ and Troubleshooting sections
* ![][im] for revisions, rewrites, and larger improvements
* ![][fe] for feedback on structure & content
* ![][qu] for questions that can't be answered via documentation
* ![][fi] for improvements and fixups related to the look and feel of the docs
  site

### Best practices for managing contributions

* If a question is asked more than twice in a support channel, it should be
  added as an outstanding ![][tr] issue. If a resolution is found, it should be
  captured in the issue before it's closed or in a following pull request.
  Those involved in the support process should contribute to the documentation
  (i.e. if you answered the question, be sure to capture the outcome in the
  relevant documentation).

* If a piece of unaddressed feedback is given more than three times, a ![][fe]
  issue should be created and added to the [Feedback Hub][fh] to be prioritized
  in the following weekly sync.

* ![][im] issues should be created to capture upcoming documentation work
  related to new features or releases.

* Issues will be reviewed on a rolling basis and triaged weekly by
  @abbey-titcomb.
