# Welcome to Radicle's docs! ðŸ‘‹

This is the repository for the Radicle documentation site at [`docs.radicle.xyz`](https://docs.radicle.xyz), which
includes user-, community-, and governance-focused documentation.

This document outlines some contributing guidelines, contact points, and other resources to make it easier to contribute
to Radicle's documentation.

[`docs.radicle.xyz`](https://docs.radicle.xyz) was created with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

If you've run into a problem or have a suggestion, browse the open
[issues](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-docs/issues) before opening a new one. We use the following [label
system](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-docs/labels) to organize our issues.

- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-fixup-critical) for typos, broken links, and other quick fixes
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-troubleshooting-%23FBCA04) for additions to the FAQ and Troubleshooting sections
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-improvement-blueviolet) for revisions, rewrites, and larger improvements
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-feedback-%23DD0BE1) for feedback on structure & content
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-question-C0EE59) for questions that can't be answered via documentation
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ui-1d76db) for improvements and fixups related to the look and feel of the docs site

## Best practices for managing contributions

- If a question is asked more than twice in a support channel, it should be added as an outstanding
  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-troubleshooting-%23FBCA04) issue. If a resolution is found, it should be captured in
  the issue before it's closed or in a following pull request. Those involved in the support process should contribute
  to the documentation (i.e. if you answered the question, be sure to capture the outcome in the relevant
  documentation).

- If a piece of unaddressed feedback is given more than three times, a
  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-feedback-%23DD0BE1) issue should be created.

- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-improvement-blueviolet) issues should be created to capture upcoming documentation
  work related to new features or releases.

## How to contribute

First, create a fork of the `radicle-docs` repository and clone that to your local system, which is where you'll make
your edits and create Git commits.

If you want to run the website locally, you'll need NodeJS and Yarn installed on your system. Then navigate into the `radicle-docs` folder on your local system and install dependencies:

```sh
cd radicle-docs/
yarn install
```

You can then run the dev server and access it at `http://localhost:3000` from your browser of choice.

```sh
yarn start
```

### Add a new doc

When you create a new Markdown document in the `docs/` folder &mdash; we very prefer `.mdx` files, by the way! &mdash;
make sure your frontmatter section includes an `id` that matches the filename and a `title` field, which Docusaurus uses
on the website directly.

You *must* add your new doc to the sidebar, which is specified in `sidebars.js`. Find the appropriate place in the
sidebar for your doc, create a newline, and add the `id` of your doc.

```javascript
const sidebars = {
  docsSidebar: [
    ...
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Example',
      collapsed: false,
      items: [
        'using-radicle/create',
        'your-new-doc',         // A new document with the `id` of `your-new-doc`.
      ]
    },
  ...
  ]
...
}
```

For more information about adding new docs to the sidebar, see the [Docusaurus
docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/navigation).
