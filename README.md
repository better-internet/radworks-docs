# Welcome to Radicle Docs ðŸ‘‹

This is the repository for the Radicle documentation site [docs.radicle.xyz](https://docs.radicle.xyz/docs/what-is-radicle.html). radicle-docs accepts contributions via Radicle patches and GitHub pull requests. This document outlines some contributing guidelines, contact points, and other resources to make it easier to contribute to radicle-docs.

[docs.radicle.xyz](https://docs.radicle.xyz/docs/what-is-radicle.html) was created with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Full Docusaurus documentation can be found on their [website](https://docusaurus.io/).

If you've run into a problem or have a suggestion, browse the open [issues](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-docs/issues) before opening a new one. We use the following [label system](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-docs/labels) to organize our issues.

* ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-fixup-critical) for typos, broken links, and other quick fixes

* ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-troubleshooting-%23FBCA04) for additions to the FAQ and Troubleshooting sections

* ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-improvement-blueviolet) for revisions, rewrites, and larger improvements

* ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-feedback-%23DD0BE1) for feedback on structure & content

* ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-question-C0EE59) for questions that can't be answered via documentation

* ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ui-1d76db) for improvements and fixups related to the look and feel of the docs site 

### Best practices for managing contributions

* If a question is asked more than twice in a support channel, it should be added as an outstanding ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-troubleshooting-%23FBCA04) issue. If a resolution is found, it should be captured in the issue before it's closed or in a following pull request. Those involved in the support process should contribute to the documentation (i.e. if you answered the question, be sure to capture the outcome in the relevant documentation)

* If a piece of unaddressed feedback is given more than three times, a ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-feedback-%23DD0BE1) issue should be created and added to the [Feedback Hub](https://github.com/orgs/radicle-dev/projects/19) to be prioritized in the following weekly sync. 

* ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-improvement-blueviolet) issues should be created to capture upcoming documentation work related to new features or releases. 

* Issues will be reviewed on a rolling basis and triaged weekly by @abbey-titcomb.
